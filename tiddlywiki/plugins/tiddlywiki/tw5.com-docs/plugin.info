Origins of TiddlyWiki\n\nBack in 1997 a colleague introduced me to [[Ward Cunningham's original wiki|http://c2.com/cgi/wiki]]. I was impressed that something so powerful could fit into just 700 lines of Perl, and fascinated by the radical reimagining of security and permissions. Like many other developers, I took every opportunity I could to try out various wikis, and to explore their use at work.\n\nThe allure of the wiki for me was the feeling that it could eventually disrupt the prevailing paradigm of print-oriented documents and emails.\n\nAfter watching people use wikis for a few years, I noticed that power users made extensive use of the ability to open multiple wiki pages at once in several browser tabs, making it easier for them to compare and review pages, to copy text between them and to act as a sort of queue of pages yet to be read.\n\nI felt that this ability to manipulate multiple pages at once was central to the ability to refactor a wiki, and it is generally accepted that a wiki that is lovingly refactored tends to be more useful. And yet, standard wiki user interfaces have always been designed exclusively for the presentation and manipulation of single pages at once.\n\nAll of these thoughts came together when I saw GMail in April 2004, which used Ajax cleverly to blend individual emails into threaded conversations.\n\nI started experimenting with HTML and JavaScript to explore the idea further. I'd had virtually no experience of either, just having put together some static pages and simple ASP sites in previous lives. Getting my head around these client-side technologies was painful; like everyone else, I was horrified to discover how appalling were the incompatibilities and inconsistencies of web programming.\n\n! Launch of TiddlyWiki\n\nSo, in September 2004 I released a primitive [[first version of TiddlyWiki|https://classic.tiddlywiki.com/firstversion.html]]. It was the smallest possible thing that demonstrated the idea: it was a simple, self-contained static 48KB HTML file.\n\nThe downside of writing the first version of TiddlyWiki in this way was that it made it completely impractical to use for editing - when you click 'save changes' it just pops up a window showing the data that would be saved if it were possible for an HTML page to write to the file system.\n\nMuch of the early feedback was that TiddlyWiki was neat, but that it would be more useful when it was possible to properly save changes. I was a little frustrated, as I thought I knew that it was impossible for an HTML file running in the browser to save changes to the local file system.\n\nWithin a few months I saw an experimental Firefox extension that enabled TiddlyWiki to save changes in the browser. Examining the code, I realised that the APIs that it used to write to the file system were actually available in ordinary HTML files - as long as they were loaded via a `file://` URI.\n\nI adapted the Firefox code into the core of TiddlyWiki, and soon added a similar ability for Internet Explorer (making use of an old ActiveX control that Microsoft distributed with Internet Explorer).\n\n! Growth of TiddlyWiki\n\nA major milestone in the growth of TiddlyWiki was the creation of \"GTDTiddlyWiki\" by Nathan Bowers. He took the vanilla TiddlyWiki product and adapted it for the specific application of keeping track of tasks using the popular Getting Things Done methodology. GTDTiddlyWiki was an immediate hit, being enthusiastically greeted on websites like LifeHacker.\n\nOver the next couple of years TiddlyWiki continued to grow in popularity, and gained new features and capabilities. Within a year I was able to support myself by performing bespoke development work on TiddlyWiki, notably working with wiki pioneer SocialText on the ability to synchronise changes with an online server\n\n! BT Acquisition\n\nIn May 2007, [[BT]] acquired [[Osmosoft]], my consultancy company. It was an unusual decision to acquire a company with a single employee and a tiny trickle of revenue - [[Osmosoft]] didn't even own the intellectual property in TiddlyWiki since I had handed it over to UnaMesa to assure its future for the community.\n\n[[BT]]'s motivation was to help them understand community-based ecosystems. I joined the organisation as \"Head of Open Source Innovation\", taking responsibility for open source governance, and providing advice and expertise on how to participate in open soure communities.\n\n! [[Osmosoft]] and TiddlySpace\n\nI built a team in BT under the name [[Osmosoft]]. Our purpose was to evangelise the benefits of open source, and to help other teams realise those benefits in practice. We also found that it was necessary to evangelise the use of the web in general, and web standards in particular.\n\nOur approach was to focus on showing rather than telling. We worked with the TiddlyWiki community to extend the ecosystem and we built numerous internal systems for BT (some based on TiddlyWiki and some not).\n\n[[Osmosoft]]'s chief contribution to the TiddlyWiki community was the creation of TiddlyWeb and TiddlySpace. TiddlyWeb was a robust, internet scale server for tiddlers that could also compose TiddlyWiki views of those tiddlers. TiddlySpace was an attempt to package TiddlyWeb into a more directly usable form.\n\n! Leaving BT\n\nBy the end of 2011 I was increasingly feeling that I would be better placed to realise the potential of TiddlyWiki outside of the corporate confines BT. Accordingly, I left and started work as an independent developer, primarily working on a brand new reboot of TiddlyWiki in the shape of TiddlyWiki5.\n\n! Development of TiddlyWiki5\n\nI worked on new release of TiddlyWiki from November 2011. As a programmer, working on \"version 2.0\" of something that I had already written is a very attractive proposition. It means that the requirements were fully understood, allowing me to focus on evolving the architecture needed to support the desired functionality.\n\n! The Future\n\nNow that TiddlyWiki5 has finally left \"beta\" status behind, my hope is that it will have a long life. Because it only uses standard features of HTML5 and Node.js, there is no reason why it cannot be fully operational for many years to come. My goal is for it to last for at least 25 years.\n\n//Jeremy Ruston, 20th September 2014//\n\n"},"Philosophy of Tiddlers":{"title":"Philosophy of Tiddlers","created":"20131128075743966","modified":"20140919160655340","tags":"Learning","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","text":"The purpose of recording and organising information is so that it can be used again.

TiddlyWiki on GitHub\n\nWe use GitHub Issues to manage bug reports and feature requests for TiddlyWiki. To maintain their effectiveness we endeavour to have as few open issues as possible.\n\n!! Policies for Managing Issues\n\nOpen issues should be actionable: generally either a reproducible bug report, or a specific feature request. From the perspective of the core developers, the issues list behaves like a shared todo list. Every item on the list requires a little bit of attention each time we check the list.\n\nGitHub Issues are not very good for managing ideas that are not immediately actionable. Better to use the [[TiddlyWiki discussion groups|Forums]] for open ended questions, or speculative discussions of new features.\n\n!! Creating Issues\n\nBefore creating a GitHub issue it is good etiquette to search through the existing issues to see whether the problem has already been reported. If a search isn't practical, don't worry too much; GitHub makes it easy to merge existing issues.\n\nWhen you do create an issue, remember that for effective debugging, we need as much information as possible. At a minimum, please try to include:\n\n* A descriptive title\n* A summary\n* Steps to reproduce\n* Expected behaviour\n* Context (OS, browser etc.)\n\nConsider also adding screenshots if it makes things clearer.\n\nThere's a lot of good material on the web about bug reports:\n\n* http://mhay68.tumblr.com/post/1648223018/what-makes-a-good-bug-report\n* http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html\n"},"Ace Editor Plugin by Joerg Plewe":{"title":"Ace Editor Plugin by Joerg Plewe","created":"20150403110817298","modified":"20150403111020017","tags":"Resources","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","url":"http://innoq.tiddlyspot.com","text":"A plugin to integrate the [[Ace editor|https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace]] into TiddlyWiki.\n\n{{!!url}}\n\n<<<\nBeing quite new to TW5 development I tried my best to draft a SyncAdaptor to store tiddlers in IndexedDb.

You can even organize them into virtual folders (aka aliases in Apache and mounts in Express).\n\nThe main point, of course, is that you can actually edit your files, not just look at them.

You can have as many data folders open as you want, they don't conflict (though they will each take memory).\n\nData folders store individual tiddlers instead of entire wikis. They take less disk space as they also do not store the core and plugins. This means they also save much quicker, especially over the internet.

They can perform better than embedded images, particularly with large numbers or sizes of images. However, using them breaks the single file pattern of TiddlyWiki.\n\nExternal images are used in the browser. They can be created by the Node.js configuration when it builds a TiddlyWiki, or they can be created manually within the browser.\n\n! What is an External Image\n\nAn external image is an ordinary image tiddler that has a ''_canonical_uri'' field containing the URI of the image. The URI can be absolute or relative to the HTML document. If the canonical URI is provided then the ''text'' field of the tiddler is ignored and so should be omitted.\n\n! Manually Creating External Images\n\nTo manually create an external image just create the tiddler with the appropriate image content type, and add a ''_canonical_uri'' field with a URI pointing to the actual image location.\n\n''IMPORTANT:'' Double-check your spelling. ``_canonical_uri`` is spelled [[URI|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI#The_relationship_between_URIs.2C_URLs.2C_and_URNs]], not URL.\n\n! Creating external images under Node.js\n\nThe following steps are used to create a static HTML file version of a wiki accompanied by an ''images'' folder containing the referenced external images:\n\n# Create image tiddlers in your TiddlyWikiFolders in the usual way\n# Save the images as separate files (by convention, in a subfolder named ''images'')\n# Externalise the image tiddlers by giving them a ''_canonical_uri'' field\n# Save the main HTML file\n\nNote the image files must be saved before they are externalised. Externalising them destroys the ''text'' field within the in-memory copy of the wiki store, meaning that attempts to save them will fail.\n\nFor an example see the ''externalimages'' build target of the demo ''tw5.com'' wiki:\n\n```\n--savetiddlers [is[image]] images\n--setfield [is[image]] _canonical_uri $:/core/templates/canonical-uri-external-image text/plain\n--setfield [is[image]] text \"\" text/plain\n--rendertiddler $:/core/save/all externalimages.html text/plain\n```\n\n!! Saving Separate Image Files\n\nThe following `--savetiddlers` command can be used to save the images of a wiki into an ''images'' subfolder:\n\n```\n--savetiddlers [is[image]] images\n```\n\n!! Externalising Image Tiddlers\n\nTwo `--setfield` commands are used: the first sets the ''_canonical_uri'' field to a URI derived from the title of the tiddler, and the second clears the text field.\n\n```\n--setfield [is[image]] _canonical_uri $:/core/templates/canonical-uri-external-image text/plain\n--setfield [is[image]] text \"\" text/plain\n```\n\nThe template tiddler [[$:/core/templates/canonical-uri-external-image]] contains:\n\n<pre>\n\n<$view tiddler=\"$:/core/templates/canonical-uri-external-image\" field=\"text\" format=\"text\"/>\n\n</pre>\n\nNote that these operations modify the tiddlers in the wiki store and so may affect the operation of subsequent commands.\n\n! Using External Images\n\nYou can't edit an external image directly in the browser except by changing the URI field to point to a different image.\n"},"Filters":{"title":"Filters","created":"20130827080000000","modified":"20150221225414000","tags":"Reference Concepts","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","list":"[[Introduction to filter notation]] [[Filter Syntax]]","text":"You can think of TiddlyWiki as a database in which the records are tiddlers.

WikiText can use the name as a shorthand way of [[transcluding|Transclusion]] the snippet. Such transclusions are known as <<.def \"macro calls\">>, and each call can supply a different set of parameters that get substituted for special placeholders within the snippet.\n\nFor the syntax, see [[Macros in WikiText]].\n\nMost macros are in fact just parameterised [[variables|Variables]].\n\nThey are created using the `\\define` [[pragma|Pragma]]. (Behind the scenes, this is transformed into a <<.wlink SetWidget>>, i.e. macros and variables are two sides of the same coin.)\n\nThe snippet and its incoming parameter values are treated as simple strings of characters with no WikiText meaning, at least until the placeholders have been filled in and the macro call has returned. This means that a macro can assemble and return the complete syntax of a ~WikiText component, such as a [[link|Linking in WikiText]]. (See [[Transclusion and Substitution]] for further discussion of this.)\n\nThe string returned by a macro call is parsed separately from any surrounding ~WikiText components. So a safe way to insert a special character sequence (such as `[[` or `<`) without triggering its normal ~WikiText meaning is to wrap it in a macro.\n\nWithin a snippet itself, the only markup detected is `$name$` (a placeholder for a macro parameter) and `$(name)$` (a placeholder for a [[variable|Variables]]).\n\nThe <<.mlink dumpvariables>> macro lists all variables (including macros) that are available at that position in the widget tree.\n\nAn <<.wlink ImportVariablesWidget>> widget can be used to copy macro definitions to another branch of the [[widget tree|Widgets]]. ~TiddlyWiki uses this technique internally to implement global macros -- namely any macros defined in tiddlers with the <<.tag $:/tags/Macro>> tag.\n\nFor maximum flexibility, macros can also be <<.js-macro-link \"written as JavaScript modules\">>.\n\nA similar effect to a parameterised macro call can be produced by setting [[variables|Variables]] around a [[transclusion|Transclusion]].\n\n~TiddlyWiki's core has [[several macros|Core Macros]] built in.\n"},"Messages":{"title":"Messages","created":"20140226083311937","modified":"20140226090209479","tags":"Concepts Reference","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","text":"Widget messages are generated by widgets in response to user actions.

Simple Permalinks\n\nThe simplest form of permalink ({{$:/core/images/permalink-button}}) is a single target tiddler title appended to the base URL with `#`:\n\nhttps://tiddlywiki.com/#HelloThere\n\nThe tiddler title can contain spaces if required:\n\n[[https://tiddlywiki.com/#Using TiddlyWiki on Node.js]]\n\nNote that double square brackets are not required around the target tiddler title; however, if present they are silently removed.\n\n! Story Permalinks\n\nThe permalink can also specify the story list of tiddlers that should be opened alongside the target tiddler as a [[TiddlerFilter|Filters]]:\n\n[[https://tiddlywiki.com/#TiddlerFields:Tiddlers TiddlerTags TiddlerFields ContentType]]\n\nIf the target tiddler isn't present in the story list then it is automatically inserted at the top. This means that the following two examples both target the tiddler `Tiddlers` within the story sequence `Tiddlers`, `Tags`, `TiddlerFields`:\n\n[[https://tiddlywiki.com/#Tiddlers:Tags TiddlerFields]]\n\n[[https://tiddlywiki.com/#Tiddlers:Tiddlers Tags TiddlerFields]]\n\nIt is also possible to specify a story filter without specifying a target tiddler for navigation:\n\n<a href=\"https://tiddlywiki.com/#:[tags[task]]\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">~https://tiddlywiki.com/#:[tags[task]]</a>\n\n! About URL encoding\n\nThere are technical restrictions on the legal characters in an URL fragment. To allow all tiddler titles to be addressed, illegal characters are subject to a process called \"URL encoding\" whereby problematic characters are replaced by their numeric code. For example, the space character is replaced with `%20`.\n\nBoth the target tiddler title and the story filter should be URL encoded (but not the separating colon). TiddlyWiki generates properly encoded URLs which can look quite ugly. However, in practice browsers will usually perfectly happily process arbitrary characters in URL fragments. Thus when creating permalinks manually you can choose to ignore URL encoding.\n\n! Permalink Behaviour\n\nTwo important aspects of TiddlyWiki's behaviour with permalinks can be controlled via options in the [[control panel|$:/ControlPanel]] {{$:/core/images/options-button}} ''Settings'' tab:\n\n* Whether to automatically update the address bar at each navigation, and if so whether to include the story sequence as well as the target tiddler\n* Whether the updates to the address bar should affect browser history. The default is ''no''; when switched to ''yes'' you can rewind navigation between tiddlers using the browser back and forward buttons\n\nNote that typing or navigating to a permalink will always cause the permalink to be processed, and tiddlers opened and closed as appropriate.\n\n!! Technical Details\n\nWhen TiddlyWiki starts up it processes permalinks according to the following steps; the same steps are repeated if the permalink changes dynamically (this happens in response to the user editing the address bar, for example).\n\n# If the permalink contains a colon, treat the string before as the ''target'' and the string after it as the ''story filter''\n# If the permalink doesn't contain a colon, treat the entire string as the ''target'' and mark the ''story filter'' as //unspecified//\n# If the ''story filter'' was unspecified and we're in the process of starting up, then set the ''story filter'' to the empty string if the ''target'' is specified, or to the default tiddlers if the ''target'' is unspecified\n# If the ''story filter'' was unspecified and we're not starting up, then set the ''story filter'' to the current story list\n# Evaluate the ''story filter'' as the ''story list''\n# If the ''target'' is specified and not present in the ''story list'' then add it at the top\n# If the ''target'' is specified then navigate to it, otherwise navigate to the first tiddler in the ''story list''\n"},"Pragma":{"title":"Pragma","created":"20150219175930000","modified":"20170712154519026","tags":"Concepts","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","text":"A <<.def pragma>> is a special component of WikiText that provides control over the way the remaining text is parsed.\n\nPragmas occupy lines that start with `\\`.

Adding custom-made tiddlers to the user interface\n\nYou can also create any tiddler you want and tag it with the appropriate SystemTag, and it will appear in that place. For example, if you create a tiddler 'Reminder to self', add the text 'This is a reminder' and tag it `$:/tags/EditTemplate`, the words 'This is a reminder' will appear inside every tiddler when you edit it.\n\nWhen you add new tiddlers to be displayed within tiddlers or within the page layout, you will also probably need to reposition it so that it appears precisely where you want it to appear. To do this, edit the appropriate shadow tiddler with the prefix `$:/tags/`, and insert the title of your tiddler in the proper place in the list field. For example, if you want the words 'This is a reminder' from the example above to appear above the tags editor in editing mode, edit the tiddler $:/tags/EditTemplate, go to the 'list' field, and insert `[[Reminder to self]]` right before `$:/core/ui/EditTemplate/tags`. \n\n! Creating new buttons for the ViewToolbar and page controls\n\nLet's say you have a skeleton tiddler called 'Recipe template', and you want to have a button available in the tiddler ViewToolbar to create new recipe tiddlers on demand. This will require the following steps:\n\n# You will want an image for your button. If none of the core images (shadow tiddlers with the prefix $:/core/images/) work for you, then you will need to create or acquire an SVG image (for example, one of the images at http://flaticon.com), drag it into your file so that it becomes a tiddler, edit the tiddler and adjust the height and width to 22px\n# You will want to create the tiddler that contains your tiddler. Create it, title it, and add the button code (see the code at the bottom of this tiddler for an example, with hints where you will need to adapt it). Tag it [[$:/tags/ViewToolbar]]\n# You will need to create a tiddler that tells TiddlyWiki whether your button should be visible in the toolbar or hidden. Let's title it [[$:/config/ViewToolbarButtons/Visibility/Recipe]]. Type `reveal` into the text area, and save.\n# You will want to position the button properly. Open the tiddler $:/tags/ViewToolbar and insert your button tiddler's title in the appropriate place in the list field.\n\n```\n\\define newHereButtonTags()\n[[$(currentTiddler)$]]\n\\end\n\\define newHereButton()\n<$button class=<<tv-config-toolbar-class>>>\n<$action-sendmessage\n  $message=\"tm-new-tiddler\"\n$param=\"TITLE OF YOUR SKELETON BUTTON\"\ntitle=\"New tiddler\"\n  tags=<<newHereButtonTags>> />\n<$list filter=\"[<tv-config-toolbar-icons>prefix[yes]]\">\n{{TITLE OF YOUR SVG IMAGE TIDDLER}}\n</$list>\n<$list filter=\"[<tv-config-toolbar-text>prefix[yes]]\">\n<span class=\"tc-btn-text\"><$text text=\"CAPTION FOR YOUR BUTTON\"/></span>\n</$list>\n</$button>\n\\end\n\n<<newHereButton>>\n```\n\n! Removing shadow tiddlers from the user interface\n\nIn the More > Shadows tab you will find a list of all the shadow tiddlers. In this list you will find many tiddlers with the prefix `$:/core/ui/`. These are the core tiddlers that define the user interface. These tiddlers are tagged with SystemTags, and removing or adding these tags will adjust the tiddler and page layouts.\n\nFor example, $:/core/ui/SideBar/More is the tiddler for the More tab in the Sidebar, and it is tagged with the SystemTag `$:/tags/SideBar` so that it appears in the Sidebar. Removing the tag from that tiddler will remove the More tab from the Sidebar, and reinserting the Sidebar tag to that tiddler will make it reappear in the Sidebar. \n\nYou can use the same process for any of the core user interface tiddlers with the $:/core/ui/ prefix. For example, removing the SystemTag `$:/tags/ViewTemplate` from the tiddler `$:/core/ui/ViewTemplate/subtitle` will remove the subtitles from all tiddlers.\n\nIf you modify a shadow tiddler in this way you will overwrite the pre-installed value. If you want to revert, just delete the modified tiddler to restore the underlying shadow tiddler.\n"},"Base64":{"title":"Base64","created":"20150221180826000","modified":"20150221181700000","tags":"Definitions","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","text":"<<.dlink-ex Base64 \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64\">> is a way of representing binary data, such an image, as a string of text.\n"},"BT":{"title":"BT","created":"201311010911","modified":"201311010911","text":"BT (née British Telecom) is the UK's largest telecommunications company.

Down the Rabbit-Hole\n\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\nbank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the\nbook her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in\nit, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or\nconversations?'\n\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\nhot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure\nof making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\npicking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\nclose by her.\n\nThere was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so\nVERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear!\nOh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it\noccurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time\nit all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH\nOUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on,\nAlice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had\nnever before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch\nto take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field\nafter it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large\nrabbit-hole under the hedge.\n\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\nin the world she was to get out again.\n\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep\nwell.\n\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\nplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was\ngoing to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what\nshe was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\nlooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\ncupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\nhung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as\nshe passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\nof killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as\nshe fell past it.\n\n'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shall\nthink nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at\nhome! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top\nof the house!' (Which was very likely true.)\n\nDown, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! 'I wonder how\nmany miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. 'I must be getting\nsomewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four\nthousand miles down, I think--' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several\nthings of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this\nwas not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there\nwas no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over)\n'--yes, that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude\nor Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or\nLongitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)\n\nPresently she began again. 'I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the\nearth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with\ntheir heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--' (she was rather glad\nthere WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the\nright word) '--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country\nis, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and\nshe tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling\nthrough the air! Do you think you could manage it?) 'And what an\nignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to\nask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'\n\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\ntalking again. 'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!'\n(Dinah was the cat.) 'I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at\ntea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no\nmice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very\nlike a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice\nbegan to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy\nsort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, 'Do\nbats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question,\nit didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing\noff, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with\nDinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:\ndid you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon\na heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\n\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\nshe looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\nlong passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.\nThere was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and\nwas just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my ears\nand whiskers, how late it's getting!' She was close behind it when she\nturned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\nfrom the roof.\n\nThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\nAlice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\ndoor, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\nget out again.\n\nSuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\nglass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's\nfirst thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\nbut, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\nbut at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\ntime round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\nbehind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\nlittle golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\n\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\nmuch larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage\ninto the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of\nthat dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and\nthose cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the\ndoorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, 'it\nwould be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could\nshut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.'\nFor, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately,\nthat Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really\nimpossible.\n\nThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\nback to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\nany rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\ntime she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here\nbefore,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\nlabel, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large\nletters.\n\nIt was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was\nnot going to do THAT in a hurry. 'No, I'll look first,' she said, 'and\nsee whether it's marked \"poison\" or not'; for she had read several nice\nlittle histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild\nbeasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember\nthe simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot\npoker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your\nfinger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never\nforgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked 'poison,' it is\nalmost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.\n\nHowever, this bottle was NOT marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to taste\nit, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour\nof cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot\nbuttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\n\n  *    *    *    *    *    *    *\n\n    *    *    *    *    *    *\n\n  *    *    *    *    *    *    *\n\n'What a curious feeling!' said Alice; 'I must be shutting up like a\ntelescope.'\n\nAnd so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face\nbrightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\nthrough the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she\nwaited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:\nshe felt a little nervous about this; 'for it might end, you know,' said\nAlice to herself, 'in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder\nwhat I should be like then?' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a\ncandle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember\never having seen such a thing.\n\nAfter a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\ninto the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the\ndoor, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\nwent back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\nit: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her\nbest to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\nand when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\nsat down and cried.\n\n'Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to herself,\nrather sharply; 'I advise you to leave off this minute!' She generally\ngave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),\nand sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\nher eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having\ncheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,\nfor this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.\n'But it's no use now,' thought poor Alice, 'to pretend to be two people!\nWhy, there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!'\n\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\nshe opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words\n'EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants. 'Well, I'll eat it,' said\nAlice, 'and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it\nmakes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I'll\nget into the garden, and I don't care which happens!'\n\nShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, 'Which way? Which\nway?', holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\ngrowing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\nsize: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice\nhad got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way\nthings to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on\nin the common way.\n\nSo she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\n\n  *    *    *    *    *    *    *\n\n    *    *    *    *    *    *\n\n  *    *    *    *    *    *    *\n\n\n\n\n!!! CHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears\n\n'Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that\nfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); 'now I'm\nopening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!'\n(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of\nsight, they were getting so far off). 'Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder\nwho will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure\n_I_ shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble\nmyself about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be\nkind to them,' thought Alice, 'or perhaps they won't walk the way I want\nto go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'\n\nAnd she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. 'They must\ngo by the carrier,' she thought; 'and how funny it'll seem, sending\npresents to one's own feet! And how odd the directions will look!\n\n     ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.\n       HEARTHRUG,\n         NEAR THE FENDER,\n           (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).\n\nOh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'\n\nJust then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was\nnow more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden\nkey and hurried off to the garden door.\n\nPoor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\nlook through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more\nhopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.\n\n'You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, 'a great girl like\nyou,' (she might well say this), 'to go on crying in this way! Stop this\nmoment, I tell you!' But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of\ntears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches\ndeep and reaching half down the hall.\n\nAfter a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and\nshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White\nRabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in\none hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great\nhurry, muttering to himself as he came, 'Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess!\nOh! won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!' Alice felt so\ndesperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit\ncame near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, 'If you please, sir--'\nThe Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan,\nand skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.\n\nAlice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she\nkept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: 'Dear, dear! How\nqueer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.\nI wonder if I've been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the\nsame when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a\nlittle different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who\nin the world am I? Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!' And she began thinking\nover all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to\nsee if she could have been changed for any of them.\n\n'I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, 'for her hair goes in such long\nringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't\nbe Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a\nvery little! Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I, and--oh dear, how puzzling\nit all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me\nsee: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and\nfour times seven is--oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!\nHowever, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.\nLondon is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and\nRome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been changed for\nMabel! I'll try and say \"How doth the little--\"' and she crossed her\nhands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it,\nbut her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the\nsame as they used to do:--\n\n     'How doth the little crocodile\n      Improve his shining tail,\n     And pour the waters of the Nile\n      On every golden scale!\n\n     'How cheerfully he seems to grin,\n      How neatly spread his claws,\n     And welcome little fishes in\n      With gently smiling jaws!'\n\n'I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and her eyes\nfilled with tears again as she went on, 'I must be Mabel after all, and\nI shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to\nno toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I've\nmade up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no\nuse their putting their heads down and saying \"Come up again, dear!\" I\nshall only look up and say \"Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then,\nif I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down here\ntill I'm somebody else\"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a sudden burst\nof tears, 'I do wish they WOULD put their heads down! I am so VERY tired\nof being all alone here!'\n\nAs she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see\nthat she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while\nshe was talking. 'How CAN I have done that?' she thought. 'I must\nbe growing small again.' She got up and went to the table to measure\nherself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now\nabout two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found\nout that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped\nit hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.\n\n'That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at the\nsudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; 'and\nnow for the garden!' and she ran with all speed back to the little door:\nbut, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was\nlying on the glass table as before, 'and things are worse than ever,'\nthought the poor child, 'for I never was so small as this before, never!\nAnd I declare it's too bad, that it is!'\n\nAs she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash!\nshe was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she\nhad somehow fallen into the sea, 'and in that case I can go back by\nrailway,' she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in\nher life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\nto on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\nsea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\nof lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon\nmade out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she\nwas nine feet high.\n\n'I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about, trying\nto find her way out. 'I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\nbeing drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer thing, to be sure!\nHowever, everything is queer to-day.'\n\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\noff, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\nit must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\nshe was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\nslipped in like herself.\n\n'Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, 'to speak to this mouse?\nEverything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\nlikely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying.' So she\nbegan: 'O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired\nof swimming about here, O Mouse!' (Alice thought this must be the right\nway of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\nshe remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, 'A mouse--of\na mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!') The Mouse looked at her rather\ninquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\nbut it said nothing.\n\n'Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; 'I daresay it's\na French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.' (For, with all\nher knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\nanything had happened.) So she began again: 'Ou est ma chatte?' which\nwas the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a\nsudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.\n'Oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt\nthe poor animal's feelings. 'I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'\n\n'Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. 'Would\nYOU like cats if you were me?'\n\n'Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: 'don't be angry\nabout it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd\ntake a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet\nthing,' Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the\npool, 'and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and\nwashing her face--and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's\nsuch a capital one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried\nAlice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she\nfelt certain it must be really offended. 'We won't talk about her any\nmore if you'd rather not.'\n\n'We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\ntail. 'As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always HATED\ncats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!'\n\n'I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\nconversation. 'Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?' The Mouse did not\nanswer, so Alice went on eagerly: 'There is such a nice little dog near\nour house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you\nknow, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when\nyou throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\nof things--I can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer,\nyou know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds! He\nsays it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a sorrowful\ntone, 'I'm afraid I've offended it again!' For the Mouse was swimming\naway from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in\nthe pool as it went.\n\nSo she called softly after it, 'Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\nwon't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!' When the\nMouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its\nface was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low\ntrembling voice, 'Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my\nhistory, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'\n\nIt was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\nbirds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo,\na Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the\nway, and the whole party swam to the shore.\n\n\n\n\n!!! CHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\n\nThey were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the\nbirds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close\nto them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.\n\nThe first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a\nconsultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural\nto Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had\nknown them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the\nLory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, 'I am older than\nyou, and must know better'; and this Alice would not allow without\nknowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its\nage, there was no more to be said.\n\nAt last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,\ncalled out, 'Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'LL soon make you\ndry enough!' They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse\nin the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt\nsure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.\n\n'Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, 'are you all ready? This\nis the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! \"William\nthe Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted\nto by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much\naccustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of\nMercia and Northumbria--\"'\n\n'Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.\n\n'I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: 'Did\nyou speak?'\n\n'Not I!' said the Lory hastily.\n\n'I thought you did,' said the Mouse. '--I proceed. \"Edwin and Morcar,\nthe earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand,\nthe patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable--\"'\n\n'Found WHAT?' said the Duck.\n\n'Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly: 'of course you know what\n\"it\" means.'\n\n'I know what \"it\" means well enough, when I find a thing,' said the\nDuck: 'it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the\narchbishop find?'\n\nThe Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, '\"--found\nit advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the\ncrown. William's conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his\nNormans--\" How are you getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning\nto Alice as it spoke.\n\n'As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone: 'it doesn't seem to\ndry me at all.'\n\n'In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, 'I move\nthat the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic\nremedies--'\n\n'Speak English!' said the Eaglet. 'I don't know the meaning of half\nthose long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!' And\nthe Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds\ntittered audibly.\n\n'What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone, 'was, that\nthe best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'\n\n'What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted much to know,\nbut the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak,\nand no one else seemed inclined to say anything.\n\n'Why,' said the Dodo, 'the best way to explain it is to do it.' (And, as\nyou might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell\nyou how the Dodo managed it.)\n\nFirst it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, ('the exact\nshape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party were placed\nalong the course, here and there. There was no 'One, two, three, and\naway,' but they began running when they liked, and left off when they\nliked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,\nwhen they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again,\nthe Dodo suddenly called out 'The race is over!' and they all crowded\nround it, panting, and asking, 'But who has won?'\n\nThis question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought,\nand it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead\n(the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures\nof him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said,\n'EVERYBODY has won, and all must have prizes.'\n\n'But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices asked.\n\n'Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger;\nand the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused\nway, 'Prizes! Prizes!'\n\nAlice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her\npocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had\nnot got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one\na-piece all round.\n\n'But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.\n\n'Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely. 'What else have you got in\nyour pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.\n\n'Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.\n\n'Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.\n\nThen they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly\npresented the thimble, saying 'We beg your acceptance of this elegant\nthimble'; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.\n\nAlice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave\nthat she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything\nto say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she\ncould.\n\nThe next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and\nconfusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste\ntheirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.\nHowever, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and\nbegged the Mouse to tell them something more.\n\n'You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice, 'and why\nit is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half afraid that it\nwould be offended again.\n\n'Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and\nsighing.\n\n'It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with wonder at\nthe Mouse's tail; 'but why do you call it sad?' And she kept on puzzling\nabout it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was\nsomething like this:--\n\n         'Fury said to a\n         mouse, That he\n        met in the\n       house,\n     \"Let us\n      both go to\n       law: I will\n        prosecute\n         YOU.--Come,\n           I'll take no\n           denial; We\n          must have a\n        trial: For\n      really this\n     morning I've\n    nothing\n    to do.\"\n     Said the\n      mouse to the\n       cur, \"Such\n        a trial,\n         dear Sir,\n            With\n          no jury\n        or judge,\n       would be\n      wasting\n      our\n      breath.\"\n       \"I'll be\n        judge, I'll\n         be jury,\"\n            Said\n         cunning\n          old Fury:\n          \"I'll\n          try the\n            whole\n            cause,\n              and\n           condemn\n           you\n          to\n           death.\"'\n\n\n'You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely. 'What are you\nthinking of?'\n\n'I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly: 'you had got to the fifth\nbend, I think?'\n\n'I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.\n\n'A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking\nanxiously about her. 'Oh, do let me help to undo it!'\n\n'I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up and walking\naway. 'You insult me by talking such nonsense!'\n\n'I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice. 'But you're so easily offended,\nyou know!'\n\nThe Mouse only growled in reply.\n\n'Please come back and finish your story!' Alice called after it; and the\nothers all joined in chorus, 'Yes, please do!' but the Mouse only shook\nits head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.\n\n'What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite\nout of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her\ndaughter 'Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose\nYOUR temper!' 'Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the young Crab, a little\nsnappishly. 'You're enough to try the patience of an oyster!'\n\n'I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud, addressing\nnobody in particular. 'She'd soon fetch it back!'\n\n'And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?' said the\nLory.\n\nAlice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:\n'Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for catching mice you\ncan't think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,\nshe'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!'\n\nThis speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the\nbirds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very\ncarefully, remarking, 'I really must be getting home; the night-air\ndoesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to\nits children, 'Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed!'\nOn various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.\n\n'I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a melancholy\ntone. 'Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's the best\ncat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you\nany more!' And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very\nlonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard\na little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up\neagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming\nback to finish his story.\n\n\n\n\n!!! CHAPTER IV. The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill\n\nIt was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking\nanxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard\nit muttering to itself 'The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh\nmy fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are\nferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?' Alice guessed in a\nmoment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves,\nand she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were\nnowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in\nthe pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door,\nhad vanished completely.\n\nVery soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and\ncalled out to her in an angry tone, 'Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing\nout here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan!\nQuick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once\nin the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it\nhad made.\n\n'He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran. 'How\nsurprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd better take him\nhis fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.' As she said this, she\ncame upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\nplate with the name 'W. RABBIT' engraved upon it. She went in without\nknocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the\nreal Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the\nfan and gloves.\n\n'How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, 'to be going messages for\na rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next!' And she\nbegan fancying the sort of thing that would happen: '\"Miss Alice! Come\nhere directly, and get ready for your walk!\" \"Coming in a minute,\nnurse! But I've got to see that the mouse doesn't get out.\" Only I don't\nthink,' Alice went on, 'that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it\nbegan ordering people about like that!'\n\nBy this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\nin the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs\nof tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves,\nand was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little\nbottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time\nwith the words 'DRINK ME,' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it\nto her lips. 'I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said\nto herself, 'whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what\nthis bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for really\nI'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'\n\nIt did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\ndrunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\nand had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put\ndown the bottle, saying to herself 'That's quite enough--I hope I shan't\ngrow any more--As it is, I can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't\ndrunk quite so much!'\n\nAlas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,\nand very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\nwas not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\none elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.\nStill she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\nof the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself 'Now I\ncan do no more, whatever happens. What WILL become of me?'\n\nLuckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\nand she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\nseemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\nagain, no wonder she felt unhappy.\n\n'It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, 'when one wasn't\nalways growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\nrabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole--and yet--and\nyet--it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\nCAN have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that\nkind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!\nThere ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I\ngrow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a sorrowful\ntone; 'at least there's no room to grow up any more HERE.'\n\n'But then,' thought Alice, 'shall I NEVER get any older than I am\nnow? That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--but\nthen--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!'\n\n'Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself. 'How can you learn\nlessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no room at all\nfor any lesson-books!'\n\nAnd so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making\nquite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard\na voice outside, and stopped to listen.\n\n'Mary Ann! Mary Ann!' said the voice. 'Fetch me my gloves this moment!'\nThen came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was\nthe Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\nhouse, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large\nas the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\n\nPresently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as\nthe door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it,\nthat attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself 'Then I'll\ngo round and get in at the window.'\n\n'THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\nshe heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\nhand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\nbut she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\nfrom which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\ncucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\n\nNext came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--'Pat! Pat! Where are you?' And\nthen a voice she had never heard before, 'Sure then I'm here! Digging\nfor apples, yer honour!'\n\n'Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily. 'Here! Come and\nhelp me out of THIS!' (Sounds of more broken glass.)\n\n'Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'\n\n'Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!' (He pronounced it 'arrum.')\n\n'An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole\nwindow!'\n\n'Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.'\n\n'Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!'\n\nThere was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers\nnow and then; such as, 'Sure, I don't like it, yer honour, at all, at\nall!' 'Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at last she spread out her\nhand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were\nTWO little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. 'What a number of\ncucumber-frames there must be!' thought Alice. 'I wonder what they'll do\nnext! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I'm\nsure I don't want to stay in here any longer!'\n\nShe waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a\nrumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices\nall talking together: she made out the words: 'Where's the other\nladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one; Bill's got the other--Bill!\nfetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up at this corner--No, tie 'em\ntogether first--they don't reach half high enough yet--Oh! they'll\ndo well enough; don't be particular--Here, Bill! catch hold of this\nrope--Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate--Oh, it's coming\ndown! Heads below!' (a loud crash)--'Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I\nfancy--Who's to go down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I\nwon't, then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to\ngo down the chimney!'\n\n'Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said Alice to\nherself. 'Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn't be in\nBill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but\nI THINK I can kick a little!'\n\nShe drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited\ntill she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what sort it was)\nscratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,\nsaying to herself 'This is Bill,' she gave one sharp kick, and waited to\nsee what would happen next.\n\nThe first thing she heard was a general chorus of 'There goes Bill!'\nthen the Rabbit's voice along--'Catch him, you by the hedge!' then\nsilence, and then another confusion of voices--'Hold up his head--Brandy\nnow--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell\nus all about it!'\n\nLast came a little feeble, squeaking voice, ('That's Bill,' thought\nAlice,) 'Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm better now--but I'm\na deal too flustered to tell you--all I know is, something comes at me\nlike a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!'\n\n'So you did, old fellow!' said the others.\n\n'We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice; and Alice called\nout as loud as she could, 'If you do. I'll set Dinah at you!'\n\nThere was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, 'I\nwonder what they WILL do next! If they had any sense, they'd take the\nroof off.' After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\nAlice heard the Rabbit say, 'A barrowful will do, to begin with.'\n\n'A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,\nfor the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\nwindow, and some of them hit her in the face. 'I'll put a stop to this,'\nshe said to herself, and shouted out, 'You'd better not do that again!'\nwhich produced another dead silence.\n\nAlice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\nlittle cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\nhead. 'If I eat one of these cakes,' she thought, 'it's sure to make\nSOME change in my size; and as it can't possibly make me larger, it must\nmake me smaller, I suppose.'\n\nSo she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\nbegan shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through\nthe door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little\nanimals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was\nin the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\nsomething out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\nappeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\nsafe in a thick wood.\n\n'The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she wandered\nabout in the wood, 'is to grow to my right size again; and the second\nthing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be\nthe best plan.'\n\nIt sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\narranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\nhow to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\nthe trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\ngreat hurry.\n\nAn enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\nfeebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. 'Poor little thing!'\nsaid Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but\nshe was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be\nhungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of\nall her coaxing.\n\nHardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\nheld it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\nall its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\nand made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\nto keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\nother side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\nover heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\nvery like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\nmoment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\nthe puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\nlittle way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\nall the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\nits tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\n\nThis seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\nset off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and\ntill the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\n\n'And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she leant\nagainst a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\nleaves: 'I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I'd\nonly been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I'd nearly forgotten that\nI've got to grow up again! Let me see--how IS it to be managed? I\nsuppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great\nquestion is, what?'\n\nThe great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at\nthe flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\nlooked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\nThere was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\nherself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\nbehind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\nwas on the top of it.\n\nShe stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\nmushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar,\nthat was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long\nhookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.\n\n\n\n\n!!! CHAPTER V. Advice from a Caterpillar\n\nThe Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence:\nat last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed\nher in a languid, sleepy voice.\n\n'Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.\n\nThis was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,\nrather shyly, 'I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at least I know\nwho I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been\nchanged several times since then.'\n\n'What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly. 'Explain\nyourself!'\n\n'I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, 'because I'm not\nmyself, you see.'\n\n'I don't see,' said the Caterpillar.\n\n'I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very politely,\n'for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and being so many\ndifferent sizes in a day is very confusing.'\n\n'It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.\n\n'Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; 'but when you\nhave to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then\nafter that into a butterfly, I should think you'll feel it a little\nqueer, won't you?'\n\n'Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.\n\n'Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice; 'all I know\nis, it would feel very queer to ME.'\n\n'You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously. 'Who are YOU?'\n\nWhich brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.\nAlice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such VERY\nshort remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, 'I think,\nyou ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'\n\n'Why?' said the Caterpillar.\n\nHere was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any\ngood reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant\nstate of mind, she turned away.\n\n'Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her. 'I've something important\nto say!'\n\nThis sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.\n\n'Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.\n\n'Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she\ncould.\n\n'No,' said the Caterpillar.\n\nAlice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and\nperhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some\nminutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its\narms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, 'So you think\nyou're changed, do you?'\n\n'I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; 'I can't remember things as I\nused--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!'\n\n'Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.\n\n'Well, I've tried to say \"HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE,\" but it all came\ndifferent!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.\n\n'Repeat, \"YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,\"' said the Caterpillar.\n\nAlice folded her hands, and began:--\n\n   'You are old, Father William,' the young man said,\n    'And your hair has become very white;\n   And yet you incessantly stand on your head--\n    Do you think, at your age, it is right?'\n\n   'In my youth,' Father William replied to his son,\n    'I feared it might injure the brain;\n   But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,\n    Why, I do it again and again.'\n\n   'You are old,' said the youth, 'as I mentioned before,\n    And have grown most uncommonly fat;\n   Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--\n    Pray, what is the reason of that?'\n\n   'In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\n    'I kept all my limbs very supple\n   By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--\n    Allow me to sell you a couple?'\n\n   'You are old,' said the youth, 'and your jaws are too weak\n    For anything tougher than suet;\n   Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--\n    Pray how did you manage to do it?'\n\n   'In my youth,' said his father, 'I took to the law,\n    And argued each case with my wife;\n   And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\n    Has lasted the rest of my life.'\n\n   'You are old,' said the youth, 'one would hardly suppose\n    That your eye was as steady as ever;\n   Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--\n    What made you so awfully clever?'\n\n   'I have answered three questions, and that is enough,'\n    Said his father; 'don't give yourself airs!\n   Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?\n    Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!'\n\n\n'That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.\n\n'Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly; 'some of the words\nhave got altered.'\n\n'It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar decidedly, and\nthere was silence for some minutes.\n\nThe Caterpillar was the first to speak.\n\n'What size do you want to be?' it asked.\n\n'Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied; 'only one\ndoesn't like changing so often, you know.'\n\n'I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.\n\nAlice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life\nbefore, and she felt that she was losing her temper.\n\n'Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.\n\n'Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,'\nsaid Alice: 'three inches is such a wretched height to be.'\n\n'It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing\nitself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).\n\n'But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And\nshe thought of herself, 'I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily\noffended!'\n\n'You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it put the\nhookah into its mouth and began smoking again.\n\nThis time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In\na minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth\nand yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the\nmushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,\n'One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you\ngrow shorter.'\n\n'One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to herself.\n\n'Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it\naloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.\n\nAlice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying\nto make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly\nround, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she\nstretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit\nof the edge with each hand.\n\n'And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\nthe right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent\nblow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!\n\nShe was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\nthat there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\nset to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed\nso closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\nmouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the\nlefthand bit.\n\n\n  *    *    *    *    *    *    *\n\n    *    *    *    *    *    *\n\n  *    *    *    *    *    *    *\n\n'Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of delight, which\nchanged into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders\nwere nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was\nan immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a\nsea of green leaves that lay far below her.\n\n'What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice. 'And where HAVE my\nshoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?'\nShe was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,\nexcept a little shaking among the distant green leaves.\n\nAs there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she\ntried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her\nneck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had\njust succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going\nto dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops\nof the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made\nher draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and\nwas beating her violently with its wings.\n\n'Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.\n\n'I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly. 'Let me alone!'\n\n'Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone,\nand added with a kind of sob, 'I've tried every way, and nothing seems\nto suit them!'\n\n'I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said Alice.\n\n'I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried\nhedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; 'but those\nserpents! There's no pleasing them!'\n\nAlice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in\nsaying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\n\n'As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the Pigeon;\n'but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I\nhaven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!'\n\n'I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was beginning to\nsee its meaning.\n\n'And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued the\nPigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, 'and just as I was thinking I\nshould be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from\nthe sky! Ugh, Serpent!'\n\n'But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice. 'I'm a--I'm a--'\n\n'Well! WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon. 'I can see you're trying to\ninvent something!'\n\n'I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered\nthe number of changes she had gone through that day.\n\n'A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest\ncontempt. 'I've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never ONE\nwith such a neck as that! No, no! You're a serpent; and there's no use\ndenying it. I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never tasted an\negg!'\n\n'I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very truthful\nchild; 'but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you\nknow.'\n\n'I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; 'but if they do, why then they're\na kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'\n\nThis was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a\nminute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, 'You're\nlooking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and what does it matter to me\nwhether you're a little girl or a serpent?'\n\n'It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; 'but I'm not looking\nfor eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want YOURS: I don't\nlike them raw.'\n\n'Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\ndown again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as\nshe could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and\nevery now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she\nremembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and\nshe set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the\nother, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had\nsucceeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\n\nIt was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it\nfelt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,\nand began talking to herself, as usual. 'Come, there's half my plan done\nnow! How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going\nto be, from one minute to another! However, I've got back to my right\nsize: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that\nto be done, I wonder?' As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open\nplace, with a little house in it about four feet high. 'Whoever lives\nthere,' thought Alice, 'it'll never do to come upon them THIS size: why,\nI should frighten them out of their wits!' So she began nibbling at the\nrighthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she\nhad brought herself down to nine inches high.\n\n\n\n\n!!! CHAPTER VI. Pig and Pepper\n\nFor a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what\nto do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the\nwood--(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:\notherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a\nfish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened\nby another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\nfrog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all\nover their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about,\nand crept a little way out of the wood to listen.\n\nThe Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\nnearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\nsaying, in a solemn tone, 'For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen\nto play croquet.' The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone,\nonly changing the order of the words a little, 'From the Queen. An\ninvitation for the Duchess to play croquet.'\n\nThen they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\n\nAlice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the\nwood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the\nFish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the\ndoor, staring stupidly up into the sky.\n\nAlice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\n\n'There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, 'and that for\ntwo reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you\nare; secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could\npossibly hear you.' And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise\ngoing on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then\na great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.\n\n'Please, then,' said Alice, 'how am I to get in?'\n\n'There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went on\nwithout attending to her, 'if we had the door between us. For instance,\nif you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.'\nHe was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this\nAlice thought decidedly uncivil. 'But perhaps he can't help it,' she\nsaid to herself; 'his eyes are so VERY nearly at the top of his head.\nBut at any rate he might answer questions.--How am I to get in?' she\nrepeated, aloud.\n\n'I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, 'till tomorrow--'\n\nAt this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\nskimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just grazed his nose,\nand broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.\n\n'--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly\nas if nothing had happened.\n\n'How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\n\n'ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman. 'That's the first\nquestion, you know.'\n\nIt was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. 'It's really\ndreadful,' she muttered to herself, 'the way all the creatures argue.\nIt's enough to drive one crazy!'\n\nThe Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\nremark, with variations. 'I shall sit here,' he said, 'on and off, for\ndays and days.'\n\n'But what am I to do?' said Alice.\n\n'Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.\n\n'Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately: 'he's\nperfectly idiotic!' And she opened the door and went in.\n\nThe door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from\none end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in\nthe middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring\na large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.\n\n'There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to herself,\nas well as she could for sneezing.\n\nThere was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess\nsneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\nalternately without a moment's pause. The only things in the kitchen\nthat did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on\nthe hearth and grinning from ear to ear.\n\n'Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for she was\nnot quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, 'why\nyour cat grins like that?'\n\n'It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, 'and that's why. Pig!'\n\nShe said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite\njumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby,\nand not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:--\n\n'I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know\nthat cats COULD grin.'\n\n'They all can,' said the Duchess; 'and most of 'em do.'\n\n'I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely, feeling quite\npleased to have got into a conversation.\n\n'You don't know much,' said the Duchess; 'and that's a fact.'\n\nAlice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would\nbe as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she\nwas trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\nfire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\nthe Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a\nshower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of\nthem even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\nthat it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\n\n'Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up and down in\nan agony of terror. 'Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose'; as an unusually\nlarge saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.\n\n'If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a hoarse\ngrowl, 'the world would go round a deal faster than it does.'\n\n'Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very glad to get\nan opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. 'Just think of\nwhat work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes\ntwenty-four hours to turn round on its axis--'\n\n'Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, 'chop off her head!'\n\nAlice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take\nthe hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to\nbe listening, so she went on again: 'Twenty-four hours, I THINK; or is\nit twelve? I--'\n\n'Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; 'I never could abide figures!'\nAnd with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of\nlullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of\nevery line:\n\n   'Speak roughly to your little boy,\n    And beat him when he sneezes:\n   He only does it to annoy,\n    Because he knows it teases.'\n\n         CHORUS.\n\n (In which the cook and the baby joined):--\n\n       'Wow! wow! wow!'\n\nWhile the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing\nthe baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,\nthat Alice could hardly hear the words:--\n\n   'I speak severely to my boy,\n    I beat him when he sneezes;\n   For he can thoroughly enjoy\n    The pepper when he pleases!'\n\n         CHORUS.\n\n       'Wow! wow! wow!'\n\n'Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said to Alice,\nflinging the baby at her as she spoke. 'I must go and get ready to play\ncroquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of the room. The cook threw\na frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.\n\nAlice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped\nlittle creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, 'just\nlike a star-fish,' thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting\nlike a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and\nstraightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute\nor two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.\n\nAs soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to\ntwist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right\near and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried\nit out into the open air. 'IF I don't take this child away with me,'\nthought Alice, 'they're sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be\nmurder to leave it behind?' She said the last words out loud, and the\nlittle thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).\n'Don't grunt,' said Alice; 'that's not at all a proper way of expressing\nyourself.'\n\nThe baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to\nsee what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had\na VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its\neyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not\nlike the look of the thing at all. 'But perhaps it was only sobbing,'\nshe thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any\ntears.\n\nNo, there were no tears. 'If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,'\nsaid Alice, seriously, 'I'll have nothing more to do with you. Mind\nnow!' The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible\nto say which), and they went on for some while in silence.\n\nAlice was just beginning to think to herself, 'Now, what am I to do with\nthis creature when I get it home?' when it grunted again, so violently,\nthat she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could\nbe NO mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she\nfelt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.\n\nSo she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see\nit trot away quietly into the wood. 'If it had grown up,' she said\nto herself, 'it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes\nrather a handsome pig, I think.' And she began thinking over other\nchildren she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\nto herself, 'if one only knew the right way to change them--' when she\nwas a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a\ntree a few yards off.\n\nThe Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she\nthought: still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth, so she\nfelt that it ought to be treated with respect.\n\n'Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know\nwhether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider.\n'Come, it's pleased so far,' thought Alice, and she went on. 'Would you\ntell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?'\n\n'That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said the Cat.\n\n'I don't much care where--' said Alice.\n\n'Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.\n\n'--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.\n\n'Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, 'if you only walk long\nenough.'\n\nAlice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question.\n'What sort of people live about here?'\n\n'In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round, 'lives\na Hatter: and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw, 'lives a March\nHare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.'\n\n'But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.\n\n'Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: 'we're all mad here. I'm mad.\nYou're mad.'\n\n'How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.\n\n'You must be,' said the Cat, 'or you wouldn't have come here.'\n\nAlice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on 'And how\ndo you know that you're mad?'\n\n'To begin with,' said the Cat, 'a dog's not mad. You grant that?'\n\n'I suppose so,' said Alice.\n\n'Well, then,' the Cat went on, 'you see, a dog growls when it's angry,\nand wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm pleased, and\nwag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.'\n\n'I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.\n\n'Call it what you like,' said the Cat. 'Do you play croquet with the\nQueen to-day?'\n\n'I should like it very much,' said Alice, 'but I haven't been invited\nyet.'\n\n'You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.\n\nAlice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer\nthings happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,\nit suddenly appeared again.\n\n'By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said the Cat. 'I'd nearly\nforgotten to ask.'\n\n'It turned into a pig,' Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back\nin a natural way.\n\n'I thought it would,' said the Cat, and vanished again.\n\nAlice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not\nappear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in\nwhich the March Hare was said to live. 'I've seen hatters before,' she\nsaid to herself; 'the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and\nperhaps as this is May it won't be raving mad--at least not so mad as\nit was in March.' As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat\nagain, sitting on a branch of a tree.\n\n'Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat.\n\n'I said pig,' replied Alice; 'and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and\nvanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.'\n\n'All right,' said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,\nbeginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which\nremained some time after the rest of it had gone.\n\n'Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice; 'but a grin\nwithout a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!'\n\nShe had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house\nof the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the\nchimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It\nwas so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had\nnibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to\nabout two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly,\nsaying to herself 'Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost\nwish I'd gone to see the Hatter instead!'\n\n\n\n\n!!! CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party\n\nThere was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\nMarch Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting\nbetween them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a\ncushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. 'Very\nuncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice; 'only, as it's asleep, I\nsuppose it doesn't mind.'\n\nThe table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\none corner of it: 'No room! No room!' they cried out when they saw Alice\ncoming. 'There's PLENTY of room!' said Alice indignantly, and she sat\ndown in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.\n\n'Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.\n\nAlice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.\n'I don't see any wine,' she remarked.\n\n'There isn't any,' said the March Hare.\n\n'Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice angrily.\n\n'It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited,' said\nthe March Hare.\n\n'I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; 'it's laid for a great\nmany more than three.'\n\n'Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice\nfor some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.\n\n'You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said with some\nseverity; 'it's very rude.'\n\nThe Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he SAID\nwas, 'Why is a raven like a writing-desk?'\n\n'Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice. 'I'm glad they've\nbegun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she added aloud.\n\n'Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?' said the\nMarch Hare.\n\n'Exactly so,' said Alice.\n\n'Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.\n\n'I do,' Alice hastily replied; 'at least--at least I mean what I\nsay--that's the same thing, you know.'\n\n'Not the same thing a bit!' said the Hatter. 'You might just as well say\nthat \"I see what I eat\" is the same thing as \"I eat what I see\"!'\n\n'You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, 'that \"I like what I\nget\" is the same thing as \"I get what I like\"!'\n\n'You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to be\ntalking in his sleep, 'that \"I breathe when I sleep\" is the same thing\nas \"I sleep when I breathe\"!'\n\n'It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the\nconversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice\nthought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks,\nwhich wasn't much.\n\nThe Hatter was the first to break the silence. 'What day of the month\nis it?' he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his\npocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,\nand holding it to his ear.\n\nAlice considered a little, and then said 'The fourth.'\n\n'Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter. 'I told you butter wouldn't suit\nthe works!' he added looking angrily at the March Hare.\n\n'It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.\n\n'Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter grumbled:\n'you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'\n\nThe March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped\nit into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of\nnothing better to say than his first remark, 'It was the BEST butter,\nyou know.'\n\nAlice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. 'What a\nfunny watch!' she remarked. 'It tells the day of the month, and doesn't\ntell what o'clock it is!'\n\n'Why should it?' muttered the Hatter. 'Does YOUR watch tell you what\nyear it is?'\n\n'Of course not,' Alice replied very readily: 'but that's because it\nstays the same year for such a long time together.'\n\n'Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.\n\nAlice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to have no\nsort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. 'I don't quite\nunderstand you,' she said, as politely as she could.\n\n'The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured a little\nhot tea upon its nose.\n\nThe Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its\neyes, 'Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.'\n\n'Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to Alice\nagain.\n\n'No, I give it up,' Alice replied: 'what's the answer?'\n\n'I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.\n\n'Nor I,' said the March Hare.\n\nAlice sighed wearily. 'I think you might do something better with the\ntime,' she said, 'than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.'\n\n'If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, 'you wouldn't talk\nabout wasting IT. It's HIM.'\n\n'I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.\n\n'Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously.\n'I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'\n\n'Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied: 'but I know I have to beat time\nwhen I learn music.'\n\n'Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter. 'He won't stand beating.\nNow, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything\nyou liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in\nthe morning, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a\nhint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,\ntime for dinner!'\n\n('I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)\n\n'That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully: 'but then--I\nshouldn't be hungry for it, you know.'\n\n'Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter: 'but you could keep it to\nhalf-past one as long as you liked.'\n\n'Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.\n\nThe Hatter shook his head mournfully. 'Not I!' he replied. 'We\nquarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--' (pointing\nwith his tea spoon at the March Hare,) '--it was at the great concert\ngiven by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\n\n     \"Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\n     How I wonder what you're at!\"\n\nYou know the song, perhaps?'\n\n'I've heard something like it,' said Alice.\n\n'It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, 'in this way:--\n\n     \"Up above the world you fly,\n     Like a tea-tray in the sky.\n         Twinkle, twinkle--\"'\n\nHere the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep 'Twinkle,\ntwinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that they had to pinch\nit to make it stop.\n\n'Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter, 'when the\nQueen jumped up and bawled out, \"He's murdering the time! Off with his\nhead!\"'\n\n'How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.\n\n'And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, 'he won't\ndo a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.'\n\nA bright idea came into Alice's head. 'Is that the reason so many\ntea-things are put out here?' she asked.\n\n'Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh: 'it's always tea-time,\nand we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'\n\n'Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.\n\n'Exactly so,' said the Hatter: 'as the things get used up.'\n\n'But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice ventured\nto ask.\n\n'Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted, yawning.\n'I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.'\n\n'I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at the\nproposal.\n\n'Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried. 'Wake up, Dormouse!' And\nthey pinched it on both sides at once.\n\nThe Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. 'I wasn't asleep,' he said in a\nhoarse, feeble voice: 'I heard every word you fellows were saying.'\n\n'Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.\n\n'Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.\n\n'And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, 'or you'll be asleep again\nbefore it's done.'\n\n'Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the Dormouse began\nin a great hurry; 'and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and\nthey lived at the bottom of a well--'\n\n'What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great interest in\nquestions of eating and drinking.\n\n'They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or\ntwo.\n\n'They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently remarked; 'they'd\nhave been ill.'\n\n'So they were,' said the Dormouse; 'VERY ill.'\n\nAlice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of\nliving would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: 'But\nwhy did they live at the bottom of a well?'\n\n'Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\n\n'I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, 'so I can't\ntake more.'\n\n'You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter: 'it's very easy to take\nMORE than nothing.'\n\n'Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.\n\n'Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked triumphantly.\n\nAlice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself\nto some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and\nrepeated her question. 'Why did they live at the bottom of a well?'\n\nThe Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\nsaid, 'It was a treacle-well.'\n\n'There's no such thing!' Alice was beginning very angrily, but the\nHatter and the March Hare went 'Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse sulkily\nremarked, 'If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for\nyourself.'\n\n'No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; 'I won't interrupt again. I\ndare say there may be ONE.'\n\n'One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to\ngo on. 'And so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw,\nyou know--'\n\n'What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\n\n'Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.\n\n'I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter: 'let's all move one place\non.'\n\nHe moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare\nmoved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather unwillingly took\nthe place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any\nadvantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than\nbefore, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.\n\nAlice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very\ncautiously: 'But I don't understand. Where did they draw the treacle\nfrom?'\n\n'You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; 'so I should\nthink you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?'\n\n'But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to\nnotice this last remark.\n\n'Of course they were', said the Dormouse; '--well in.'\n\nThis answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for\nsome time without interrupting it.\n\n'They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing\nits eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; 'and they drew all manner of\nthings--everything that begins with an M--'\n\n'Why with an M?' said Alice.\n\n'Why not?' said the March Hare.\n\nAlice was silent.\n\nThe Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into\na doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with\na little shriek, and went on: '--that begins with an M, such as\nmouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--you know you say\nthings are \"much of a muchness\"--did you ever see such a thing as a\ndrawing of a muchness?'\n\n'Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, 'I don't\nthink--'\n\n'Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.\n\nThis piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in\ngreat disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and\nneither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\nlooked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:\nthe last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into\nthe teapot.\n\n'At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she picked her\nway through the wood. 'It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all\nmy life!'\n\nJust as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door\nleading right into it. 'That's very curious!' she thought. 'But\neverything's curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.' And in\nshe went.\n\nOnce more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little\nglass table. 'Now, I'll manage better this time,' she said to herself,\nand began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that\nled into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she\nhad kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high:\nthen she walked down the little passage: and THEN--she found herself at\nlast in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool\nfountains.\n\n\n\n\n!!! CHAPTER VIII. The Queen's Croquet-Ground\n\nA large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses\ngrowing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily\npainting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went\nnearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of\nthem say, 'Look out now, Five! Don't go splashing paint over me like\nthat!'\n\n'I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; 'Seven jogged my\nelbow.'\n\nOn which Seven looked up and said, 'That's right, Five! Always lay the\nblame on others!'\n\n'YOU'D better not talk!' said Five. 'I heard the Queen say only\nyesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'\n\n'What for?' said the one who had spoken first.\n\n'That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.\n\n'Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, 'and I'll tell him--it was for\nbringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'\n\nSeven flung down his brush, and had just begun 'Well, of all the unjust\nthings--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching\nthem, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and\nall of them bowed low.\n\n'Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, 'why you are painting\nthose roses?'\n\nFive and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low\nvoice, 'Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a\nRED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen\nwas to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know.\nSo you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she comes, to--' At this\nmoment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called\nout 'The Queen! The Queen!' and the three gardeners instantly threw\nthemselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,\nand Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.\n\nFirst came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like\nthe three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the\ncorners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with\ndiamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came\nthe royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\njumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented\nwith hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among\nthem Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried\nnervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without\nnoticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's\ncrown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand\nprocession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\n\nAlice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face\nlike the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard\nof such a rule at processions; 'and besides, what would be the use of\na procession,' thought she, 'if people had all to lie down upon their\nfaces, so that they couldn't see it?' So she stood still where she was,\nand waited.\n\nWhen the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked\nat her, and the Queen said severely 'Who is this?' She said it to the\nKnave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.\n\n'Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to\nAlice, she went on, 'What's your name, child?'\n\n'My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very politely;\nbut she added, to herself, 'Why, they're only a pack of cards, after\nall. I needn't be afraid of them!'\n\n'And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who\nwere lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as they were lying on their\nfaces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the\npack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or\ncourtiers, or three of her own children.\n\n'How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage. 'It's no\nbusiness of MINE.'\n\nThe Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a\nmoment like a wild beast, screamed 'Off with her head! Off--'\n\n'Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was\nsilent.\n\nThe King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said 'Consider, my\ndear: she is only a child!'\n\nThe Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave 'Turn them\nover!'\n\nThe Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.\n\n'Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three\ngardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,\nthe royal children, and everybody else.\n\n'Leave off that!' screamed the Queen. 'You make me giddy.' And then,\nturning to the rose-tree, she went on, 'What HAVE you been doing here?'\n\n'May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone, going\ndown on one knee as he spoke, 'we were trying--'\n\n'I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.\n'Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on, three of the\nsoldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran\nto Alice for protection.\n\n'You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a large\nflower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a\nminute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the\nothers.\n\n'Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.\n\n'Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers shouted\nin reply.\n\n'That's right!' shouted the Queen. 'Can you play croquet?'\n\nThe soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was\nevidently meant for her.\n\n'Yes!' shouted Alice.\n\n'Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,\nwondering very much what would happen next.\n\n'It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side. She was\nwalking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.\n\n'Very,' said Alice: '--where's the Duchess?'\n\n'Hush! Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked\nanxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon\ntiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered 'She's under\nsentence of execution.'\n\n'What for?' said Alice.\n\n'Did you say \"What a pity!\"?' the Rabbit asked.\n\n'No, I didn't,' said Alice: 'I don't think it's at all a pity. I said\n\"What for?\"'\n\n'She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little\nscream of laughter. 'Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a frightened\ntone. 'The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the\nQueen said--'\n\n'Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and\npeople began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\nother; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\nbegan. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in\nher life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs,\nthe mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves\nup and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\n\nThe chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:\nshe succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under\nher arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got\nits neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a\nblow with its head, it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face,\nwith such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out\nlaughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin\nagain, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled\nitself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was\ngenerally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the\nhedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up\nand walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the\nconclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.\n\nThe players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling\nall the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short\ntime the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and\nshouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her head!' about once in a\nminute.\n\nAlice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any\ndispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\n'and then,' thought she, 'what would become of me? They're dreadfully\nfond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there's any one\nleft alive!'\n\nShe was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\ncould get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance\nin the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it\na minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself\n'It's the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.'\n\n'How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\nenough for it to speak with.\n\nAlice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. 'It's no use\nspeaking to it,' she thought, 'till its ears have come, or at least one\nof them.' In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put\ndown her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\nshe had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there was\nenough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.\n\n'I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather a\ncomplaining tone, 'and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear\noneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in particular;\nat least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you've no idea how\nconfusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there's the\narch I've got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\nground--and I should have croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only\nit ran away when it saw mine coming!'\n\n'How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.\n\n'Not at all,' said Alice: 'she's so extremely--' Just then she noticed\nthat the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,\n'--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while finishing the game.'\n\nThe Queen smiled and passed on.\n\n'Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and looking\nat the Cat's head with great curiosity.\n\n'It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice: 'allow me to\nintroduce it.'\n\n'I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King: 'however, it may\nkiss my hand if it likes.'\n\n'I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.\n\n'Don't be impertinent,' said the King, 'and don't look at me like that!'\nHe got behind Alice as he spoke.\n\n'A cat may look at a king,' said Alice. 'I've read that in some book,\nbut I don't remember where.'\n\n'Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and he called\nthe Queen, who was passing at the moment, 'My dear! I wish you would\nhave this cat removed!'\n\nThe Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small.\n'Off with his head!' she said, without even looking round.\n\n'I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and he\nhurried off.\n\nAlice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going\non, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance, screaming with\npassion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\nexecuted for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\nof things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\nwhether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.\n\nThe hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed\nto Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\nother: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the\nother side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless\nsort of way to fly up into a tree.\n\nBy the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\nwas over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: 'but it doesn't\nmatter much,' thought Alice, 'as all the arches are gone from this side\nof the ground.' So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not\nescape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her\nfriend.\n\nWhen she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a\nlarge crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between\nthe executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,\nwhile all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.\n\nThe moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle\nthe question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they\nall spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly\nwhat they said.\n\nThe executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head unless\nthere was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a\nthing before, and he wasn't going to begin at HIS time of life.\n\nThe King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be\nbeheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.\n\nThe Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about it in less\nthan no time she'd have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last\nremark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)\n\nAlice could think of nothing else to say but 'It belongs to the Duchess:\nyou'd better ask HER about it.'\n\n'She's in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner: 'fetch her here.'\nAnd the executioner went off like an arrow.\n\n The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,\nby the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely\ndisappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down\nlooking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.\n\n\n\n\n!!! CHAPTER IX. The Mock Turtle's Story\n\n'You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!'\nsaid the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice's, and\nthey walked off together.\n\nAlice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought\nto herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so\nsavage when they met in the kitchen.\n\n'When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone\nthough), 'I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT ALL. Soup does very\nwell without--Maybe it's always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,'\nshe went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of\nrule, 'and vinegar that makes them sour--and camomile that makes\nthem bitter--and--and barley-sugar and such things that make children\nsweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn't be so\nstingy about it, you know--'\n\nShe had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little\nstartled when she heard her voice close to her ear. 'You're thinking\nabout something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can't\ntell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in\na bit.'\n\n'Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.\n\n'Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess. 'Everything's got a moral, if only\nyou can find it.' And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice's side as\nshe spoke.\n\nAlice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the\nDuchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the\nright height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder, and it was an\nuncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she\nbore it as well as she could.\n\n'The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of keeping up\nthe conversation a little.\n\n''Tis so,' said the Duchess: 'and the moral of that is--\"Oh, 'tis love,\n'tis love, that makes the world go round!\"'\n\n'Somebody said,' Alice whispered, 'that it's done by everybody minding\ntheir own business!'\n\n'Ah, well! It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess, digging her\nsharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added, 'and the moral\nof THAT is--\"Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of\nthemselves.\"'\n\n'How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to herself.\n\n'I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your waist,'\nthe Duchess said after a pause: 'the reason is, that I'm doubtful about\nthe temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?'\n\n'HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to\nhave the experiment tried.\n\n'Very true,' said the Duchess: 'flamingoes and mustard both bite. And\nthe moral of that is--\"Birds of a feather flock together.\"'\n\n'Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.\n\n'Right, as usual,' said the Duchess: 'what a clear way you have of\nputting things!'\n\n'It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.\n\n'Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to\neverything that Alice said; 'there's a large mustard-mine near here. And\nthe moral of that is--\"The more there is of mine, the less there is of\nyours.\"'\n\n'Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark,\n'it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it is.'\n\n'I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; 'and the moral of that\nis--\"Be what you would seem to be\"--or if you'd like it put more\nsimply--\"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might\nappear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise\nthan what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.\"'\n\n'I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very politely, 'if\nI had it written down: but I can't quite follow it as you say it.'\n\n'That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess replied, in\na pleased tone.\n\n'Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,' said\nAlice.\n\n'Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the Duchess. 'I make you a present\nof everything I've said as yet.'\n\n'A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice. 'I'm glad they don't give\nbirthday presents like that!' But she did not venture to say it out\nloud.\n\n'Thinking again?' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp\nlittle chin.\n\n'I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to\nfeel a little worried.\n\n'Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, 'as pigs have to fly; and\nthe m--'\n\nBut here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died away, even\nin the middle of her favourite word 'moral,' and the arm that was linked\ninto hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen\nin front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.\n\n'A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.\n\n'Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on the\nground as she spoke; 'either you or your head must be off, and that in\nabout half no time! Take your choice!'\n\nThe Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.\n\n'Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was\ntoo much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the\ncroquet-ground.\n\nThe other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence, and were\nresting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried\nback to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment's delay would\ncost them their lives.\n\nAll the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with\nthe other players, and shouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her\nhead!' Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers,\nwho of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by\nthe end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the\nplayers, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and\nunder sentence of execution.\n\nThen the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, 'Have\nyou seen the Mock Turtle yet?'\n\n'No,' said Alice. 'I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'\n\n'It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.\n\n'I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.\n\n'Come on, then,' said the Queen, 'and he shall tell you his history,'\n\nAs they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,\nto the company generally, 'You are all pardoned.' 'Come, THAT'S a good\nthing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the\nnumber of executions the Queen had ordered.\n\nThey very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun.\n(IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) 'Up, lazy\nthing!' said the Queen, 'and take this young lady to see the Mock\nTurtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some\nexecutions I have ordered'; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with\nthe Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on\nthe whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go\nafter that savage Queen: so she waited.\n\nThe Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till\nshe was out of sight: then it chuckled. 'What fun!' said the Gryphon,\nhalf to itself, half to Alice.\n\n'What IS the fun?' said Alice.\n\n'Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon. 'It's all her fancy, that: they never\nexecutes nobody, you know. Come on!'\n\n'Everybody says \"come on!\" here,' thought Alice, as she went slowly\nafter it: 'I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!'\n\nThey had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,\nsitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came\nnearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She\npitied him deeply. 'What is his sorrow?' she asked the Gryphon, and the\nGryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, 'It's all his\nfancy, that: he hasn't got no sorrow, you know. Come on!'\n\nSo they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\nfull of tears, but said nothing.\n\n'This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, 'she wants for to know your\nhistory, she do.'\n\n'I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: 'sit\ndown, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished.'\n\nSo they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to\nherself, 'I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he doesn't begin.' But\nshe waited patiently.\n\n'Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, 'I was a real\nTurtle.'\n\nThese words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an\noccasional exclamation of 'Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and the constant\nheavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and\nsaying, 'Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,' but she could\nnot help thinking there MUST be more to come, so she sat still and said\nnothing.\n\n'When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,\nthough still sobbing a little now and then, 'we went to school in the\nsea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call him Tortoise--'\n\n'Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.\n\n'We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock Turtle\nangrily: 'really you are very dull!'\n\n'You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,'\nadded the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor\nAlice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said\nto the Mock Turtle, 'Drive on, old fellow! Don't be all day about it!'\nand he went on in these words:\n\n'Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it--'\n\n'I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.\n\n'You did,' said the Mock Turtle.\n\n'Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.\nThe Mock Turtle went on.\n\n'We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every day--'\n\n'I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; 'you needn't be so proud\nas all that.'\n\n'With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.\n\n'Yes,' said Alice, 'we learned French and music.'\n\n'And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.\n\n'Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.\n\n'Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock Turtle in\na tone of great relief. 'Now at OURS they had at the end of the bill,\n\"French, music, AND WASHING--extra.\"'\n\n'You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; 'living at the bottom of\nthe sea.'\n\n'I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. 'I\nonly took the regular course.'\n\n'What was that?' inquired Alice.\n\n'Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock Turtle\nreplied; 'and then the different branches of Arithmetic--Ambition,\nDistraction, Uglification, and Derision.'\n\n'I never heard of \"Uglification,\"' Alice ventured to say. 'What is it?'\n\nThe Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. 'What! Never heard of\nuglifying!' it exclaimed. 'You know what to beautify is, I suppose?'\n\n'Yes,' said Alice doubtfully: 'it means--to--make--anything--prettier.'\n\n'Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, 'if you don't know what to uglify is,\nyou ARE a simpleton.'\n\nAlice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she\nturned to the Mock Turtle, and said 'What else had you to learn?'\n\n'Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting off\nthe subjects on his flappers, '--Mystery, ancient and modern, with\nSeaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,\nthat used to come once a week: HE taught us Drawling, Stretching, and\nFainting in Coils.'\n\n'What was THAT like?' said Alice.\n\n'Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said: 'I'm too\nstiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.'\n\n'Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon: 'I went to the Classics master, though.\nHe was an old crab, HE was.'\n\n'I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: 'he taught\nLaughing and Grief, they used to say.'\n\n'So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both\ncreatures hid their faces in their paws.\n\n'And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a hurry to\nchange the subject.\n\n'Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: 'nine the next, and so\non.'\n\n'What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.\n\n'That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon remarked:\n'because they lessen from day to day.'\n\nThis was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little\nbefore she made her next remark. 'Then the eleventh day must have been a\nholiday?'\n\n'Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.\n\n'And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.\n\n'That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided\ntone: 'tell her something about the games now.'\n\n\n\n\n!!! CHAPTER X. The Lobster Quadrille\n\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across\nhis eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or\ntwo sobs choked his voice. 'Same as if he had a bone in his throat,'\nsaid the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in\nthe back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears\nrunning down his cheeks, he went on again:--\n\n'You may not have lived much under the sea--' ('I haven't,' said\nAlice)--'and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--'\n(Alice began to say 'I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily, and\nsaid 'No, never') '--so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a\nLobster Quadrille is!'\n\n'No, indeed,' said Alice. 'What sort of a dance is it?'\n\n'Why,' said the Gryphon, 'you first form into a line along the\nsea-shore--'\n\n'Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle. 'Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;\nthen, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--'\n\n'THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted the Gryphon.\n\n'--you advance twice--'\n\n'Each with a lobster as a partner!' cried the Gryphon.\n\n'Of course,' the Mock Turtle said: 'advance twice, set to partners--'\n\n'--change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the Gryphon.\n\n'Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle went on, 'you throw the--'\n\n'The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.\n\n'--as far out to sea as you can--'\n\n'Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon.\n\n'Turn a somersault in the sea!' cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly\nabout.\n\n'Change lobsters again!' yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.\n\n'Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the Mock\nTurtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been\njumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly\nand quietly, and looked at Alice.\n\n'It must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly.\n\n'Would you like to see a little of it?' said the Mock Turtle.\n\n'Very much indeed,' said Alice.\n\n'Come, let's try the first figure!' said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon.\n'We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?'\n\n'Oh, YOU sing,' said the Gryphon. 'I've forgotten the words.'\n\nSo they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and\nthen treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their\nforepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly\nand sadly:--\n\n '\"Will you walk a little faster?\" said a whiting to a snail.\n \"There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail.\n\n See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!\n They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance?\n\n Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?\n Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?\n\n \"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be\n When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!\"\n But the snail replied \"Too far, too far!\" and gave a look askance--\n Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.\n\n Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.\n Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.\n\n '\"What matters it how far we go?\" his scaly friend replied.\n \"There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.\n The further off from England the nearer is to France--\n Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.\n\n Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?\n Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?\"'\n\n'Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said Alice, feeling\nvery glad that it was over at last: 'and I do so like that curious song\nabout the whiting!'\n\n'Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock Turtle, 'they--you've seen them,\nof course?'\n\n'Yes,' said Alice, 'I've often seen them at dinn--' she checked herself\nhastily.\n\n'I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Mock Turtle, 'but if you've\nseen them so often, of course you know what they're like.'\n\n'I believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully. 'They have their tails in\ntheir mouths--and they're all over crumbs.'\n\n'You're wrong about the crumbs,' said the Mock Turtle: 'crumbs would all\nwash off in the sea. But they HAVE their tails in their mouths; and the\nreason is--' here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.--'Tell her\nabout the reason and all that,' he said to the Gryphon.\n\n'The reason is,' said the Gryphon, 'that they WOULD go with the lobsters\nto the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long\nway. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn't get\nthem out again. That's all.'\n\n'Thank you,' said Alice, 'it's very interesting. I never knew so much\nabout a whiting before.'\n\n'I can tell you more than that, if you like,' said the Gryphon. 'Do you\nknow why it's called a whiting?'\n\n'I never thought about it,' said Alice. 'Why?'\n\n'IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very solemnly.\n\nAlice was thoroughly puzzled. 'Does the boots and shoes!' she repeated\nin a wondering tone.\n\n'Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the Gryphon. 'I mean, what\nmakes them so shiny?'\n\nAlice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her\nanswer. 'They're done with blacking, I believe.'\n\n'Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,\n'are done with a whiting. Now you know.'\n\n'And what are they made of?' Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.\n\n'Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:\n'any shrimp could have told you that.'\n\n'If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were still running\non the song, 'I'd have said to the porpoise, \"Keep back, please: we\ndon't want YOU with us!\"'\n\n'They were obliged to have him with them,' the Mock Turtle said: 'no\nwise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.'\n\n'Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise.\n\n'Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle: 'why, if a fish came to ME, and\ntold me he was going a journey, I should say \"With what porpoise?\"'\n\n'Don't you mean \"purpose\"?' said Alice.\n\n'I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And\nthe Gryphon added 'Come, let's hear some of YOUR adventures.'\n\n'I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,' said\nAlice a little timidly: 'but it's no use going back to yesterday,\nbecause I was a different person then.'\n\n'Explain all that,' said the Mock Turtle.\n\n'No, no! The adventures first,' said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:\n'explanations take such a dreadful time.'\n\nSo Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first\nsaw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,\nthe two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened\ntheir eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she went\non. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about\nher repeating 'YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the\nwords all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath,\nand said 'That's very curious.'\n\n'It's all about as curious as it can be,' said the Gryphon.\n\n'It all came different!' the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. 'I\nshould like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to\nbegin.' He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of\nauthority over Alice.\n\n'Stand up and repeat \"'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,\"' said the\nGryphon.\n\n'How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!'\nthought Alice; 'I might as well be at school at once.' However, she\ngot up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster\nQuadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came\nvery queer indeed:--\n\n  ''Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,\n  \"You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.\"\n  As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose\n  Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.'\n\n       [later editions continued as follows\n  When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,\n  And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,\n  But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,\n  His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]\n\n'That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,' said the\nGryphon.\n\n'Well, I never heard it before,' said the Mock Turtle; 'but it sounds\nuncommon nonsense.'\n\nAlice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,\nwondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way again.\n\n'I should like to have it explained,' said the Mock Turtle.\n\n'She can't explain it,' said the Gryphon hastily. 'Go on with the next\nverse.'\n\n'But about his toes?' the Mock Turtle persisted. 'How COULD he turn them\nout with his nose, you know?'\n\n'It's the first position in dancing.' Alice said; but was dreadfully\npuzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.\n\n'Go on with the next verse,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently: 'it\nbegins \"I passed by his garden.\"'\n\nAlice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come\nwrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--\n\n  'I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,\n  How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--'\n\n    [later editions continued as follows\n  The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,\n  While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.\n  When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,\n  Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:\n  While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,\n  And concluded the banquet--]\n\n'What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,' the Mock Turtle\ninterrupted, 'if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far the most\nconfusing thing I ever heard!'\n\n'Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon: and Alice was\nonly too glad to do so.\n\n'Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?' the Gryphon went\non. 'Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?'\n\n'Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,' Alice\nreplied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,\n'Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her \"Turtle Soup,\" will you, old\nfellow?'\n\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked\nwith sobs, to sing this:--\n\n   'Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,\n   Waiting in a hot tureen!\n   Who for such dainties would not stoop?\n   Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\n   Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\n     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!\n     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!\n   Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,\n     Beautiful, beautiful Soup!\n\n   'Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,\n   Game, or any other dish?\n   Who would not give all else for two\n   Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\n   Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\n     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!\n     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!\n   Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,\n     Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!'\n\n'Chorus again!' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun\nto repeat it, when a cry of 'The trial's beginning!' was heard in the\ndistance.\n\n'Come on!' cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried\noff, without waiting for the end of the song.\n\n'What trial is it?' Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only\nanswered 'Come on!' and ran the faster, while more and more faintly\ncame, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:--\n\n   'Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,\n     Beautiful, beautiful Soup!'\n\n\n\n\n!!! CHAPTER XI. Who Stole the Tarts?\n\nThe King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they\narrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little\nbirds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was\nstanding before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard\nhim; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand,\nand a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court\nwas a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good,\nthat it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--'I wish they'd get the\ntrial done,' she thought, 'and hand round the refreshments!' But there\nseemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about\nher, to pass away the time.\n\nAlice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read\nabout them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew\nthe name of nearly everything there. 'That's the judge,' she said to\nherself, 'because of his great wig.'\n\nThe judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the\nwig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did\nnot look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.\n\n'And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, 'and those twelve creatures,'\n(she was obliged to say 'creatures,' you see, because some of them were\nanimals, and some were birds,) 'I suppose they are the jurors.' She said\nthis last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of\nit: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her\nage knew the meaning of it at all. However, 'jury-men' would have done\njust as well.\n\nThe twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. 'What are they\ndoing?' Alice whispered to the Gryphon. 'They can't have anything to put\ndown yet, before the trial's begun.'\n\n'They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in reply, 'for\nfear they should forget them before the end of the trial.'\n\n'Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped\nhastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, 'Silence in the court!' and the\nKing put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who\nwas talking.\n\nAlice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,\nthat all the jurors were writing down 'stupid things!' on their slates,\nand she could even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell\n'stupid,' and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. 'A nice\nmuddle their slates'll be in before the trial's over!' thought Alice.\n\nOne of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice\ncould not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and\nvery soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly\nthat the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out\nat all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was\nobliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was\nof very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.\n\n'Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.\n\nOn this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then\nunrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--\n\n   'The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,\n      All on a summer day:\n    The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,\n      And took them quite away!'\n\n'Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.\n\n'Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted. 'There's a great\ndeal to come before that!'\n\n'Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three\nblasts on the trumpet, and called out, 'First witness!'\n\nThe first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one\nhand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. 'I beg pardon, your\nMajesty,' he began, 'for bringing these in: but I hadn't quite finished\nmy tea when I was sent for.'\n\n'You ought to have finished,' said the King. 'When did you begin?'\n\nThe Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the\ncourt, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. 'Fourteenth of March, I think it\nwas,' he said.\n\n'Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.\n\n'Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.\n\n'Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly\nwrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and\nreduced the answer to shillings and pence.\n\n'Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.\n\n'It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.\n\n'Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a\nmemorandum of the fact.\n\n'I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation; 'I've none of\nmy own. I'm a hatter.'\n\nHere the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,\nwho turned pale and fidgeted.\n\n'Give your evidence,' said the King; 'and don't be nervous, or I'll have\nyou executed on the spot.'\n\nThis did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting\nfrom one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in\nhis confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the\nbread-and-butter.\n\nJust at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled\nher a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to\ngrow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave\nthe court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as\nlong as there was room for her.\n\n'I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was sitting\nnext to her. 'I can hardly breathe.'\n\n'I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly: 'I'm growing.'\n\n'You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.\n\n'Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly: 'you know you're growing\ntoo.'\n\n'Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse: 'not in that\nridiculous fashion.' And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the\nother side of the court.\n\nAll this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,\njust as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers\nof the court, 'Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!' on\nwhich the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.\n\n'Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, 'or I'll have you\nexecuted, whether you're nervous or not.'\n\n'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,\n'--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the\nbread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea--'\n\n'The twinkling of the what?' said the King.\n\n'It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.\n\n'Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply. 'Do you\ntake me for a dunce? Go on!'\n\n'I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, 'and most things twinkled after\nthat--only the March Hare said--'\n\n'I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.\n\n'You did!' said the Hatter.\n\n'I deny it!' said the March Hare.\n\n'He denies it,' said the King: 'leave out that part.'\n\n'Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on, looking\nanxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied\nnothing, being fast asleep.\n\n'After that,' continued the Hatter, 'I cut some more bread-and-butter--'\n\n'But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.\n\n'That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.\n\n'You MUST remember,' remarked the King, 'or I'll have you executed.'\n\nThe miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went\ndown on one knee. 'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he began.\n\n'You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.\n\nHere one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by\nthe officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just\nexplain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied\nup at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,\nhead first, and then sat upon it.)\n\n'I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice. 'I've so often read\nin the newspapers, at the end of trials, \"There was some attempts\nat applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the\ncourt,\" and I never understood what it meant till now.'\n\n'If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,' continued the\nKing.\n\n'I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter: 'I'm on the floor, as it is.'\n\n'Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.\n\nHere the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.\n\n'Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice. 'Now we shall get\non better.'\n\n'I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the\nQueen, who was reading the list of singers.\n\n'You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,\nwithout even waiting to put his shoes on.\n\n'--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one of the\nofficers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get\nto the door.\n\n'Call the next witness!' said the King.\n\nThe next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the pepper-box in\nher hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the\ncourt, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.\n\n'Give your evidence,' said the King.\n\n'Shan't,' said the cook.\n\nThe King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,\n'Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'\n\n'Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy air, and,\nafter folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were\nnearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, 'What are tarts made of?'\n\n'Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.\n\n'Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.\n\n'Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out. 'Behead that Dormouse!\nTurn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his\nwhiskers!'\n\nFor some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse\nturned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had\ndisappeared.\n\n'Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief. 'Call the next\nwitness.' And he added in an undertone to the Queen, 'Really, my dear,\nYOU must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead\nache!'\n\nAlice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very\ncurious to see what the next witness would be like, '--for they haven't\ngot much evidence YET,' she said to herself. Imagine her surprise, when\nthe White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the\nname 'Alice!'\n\n\n\n\n!!! CHAPTER XII. Alice's Evidence\n\n\n'Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how\nlarge she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such\na hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,\nupsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there\nthey lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish\nshe had accidentally upset the week before.\n\n'Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and\nbegan picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of\nthe goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea\nthat they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or\nthey would die.\n\n'The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave voice, 'until\nall the jurymen are back in their proper places--ALL,' he repeated with\ngreat emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said do.\n\nAlice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put\nthe Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its\ntail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got\nit out again, and put it right; 'not that it signifies much,' she said\nto herself; 'I should think it would be QUITE as much use in the trial\none way up as the other.'\n\nAs soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being\nupset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to\nthem, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the\naccident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do\nanything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the\ncourt.\n\n'What do you know about this business?' the King said to Alice.\n\n'Nothing,' said Alice.\n\n'Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.\n\n'Nothing whatever,' said Alice.\n\n'That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury. They were\njust beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit\ninterrupted: 'UNimportant, your Majesty means, of course,' he said in a\nvery respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.\n\n'UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and went on\nto himself in an undertone,\n\n'important--unimportant--unimportant--important--' as if he were trying\nwhich word sounded best.\n\nSome of the jury wrote it down 'important,' and some 'unimportant.'\nAlice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;\n'but it doesn't matter a bit,' she thought to herself.\n\nAt this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in\nhis note-book, cackled out 'Silence!' and read out from his book, 'Rule\nForty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'\n\nEverybody looked at Alice.\n\n'I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.\n\n'You are,' said the King.\n\n'Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.\n\n'Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: 'besides, that's not a\nregular rule: you invented it just now.'\n\n'It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.\n\n'Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.\n\nThe King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. 'Consider your\nverdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.\n\n'There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said the White\nRabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; 'this paper has just been picked\nup.'\n\n'What's in it?' said the Queen.\n\n'I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, 'but it seems to be a\nletter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'\n\n'It must have been that,' said the King, 'unless it was written to\nnobody, which isn't usual, you know.'\n\n'Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.\n\n'It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; 'in fact, there's\nnothing written on the OUTSIDE.' He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and\nadded 'It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set of verses.'\n\n'Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of the jurymen.\n\n'No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, 'and that's the queerest thing\nabout it.' (The jury all looked puzzled.)\n\n'He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King. (The jury\nall brightened up again.)\n\n'Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, 'I didn't write it, and they\ncan't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.'\n\n'If you didn't sign it,' said the King, 'that only makes the matter\nworse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed your\nname like an honest man.'\n\nThere was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really\nclever thing the King had said that day.\n\n'That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.\n\n'It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. 'Why, you don't even know\nwhat they're about!'\n\n'Read them,' said the King.\n\nThe White Rabbit put on his spectacles. 'Where shall I begin, please\nyour Majesty?' he asked.\n\n'Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, 'and go on till you\ncome to the end: then stop.'\n\nThese were the verses the White Rabbit read:--\n\n   'They told me you had been to her,\n    And mentioned me to him:\n   She gave me a good character,\n    But said I could not swim.\n\n   He sent them word I had not gone\n    (We know it to be true):\n   If she should push the matter on,\n    What would become of you?\n\n   I gave her one, they gave him two,\n    You gave us three or more;\n   They all returned from him to you,\n    Though they were mine before.\n\n   If I or she should chance to be\n    Involved in this affair,\n   He trusts to you to set them free,\n    Exactly as we were.\n\n   My notion was that you had been\n    (Before she had this fit)\n   An obstacle that came between\n    Him, and ourselves, and it.\n\n   Don't let him know she liked them best,\n    For this must ever be\n   A secret, kept from all the rest,\n    Between yourself and me.'\n\n'That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,' said the\nKing, rubbing his hands; 'so now let the jury--'\n\n'If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had grown so large\nin the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit afraid of interrupting\nhim,) 'I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't believe there's an atom of\nmeaning in it.'\n\nThe jury all wrote down on their slates, 'SHE doesn't believe there's an\natom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to explain the paper.\n\n'If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, 'that saves a world of\ntrouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And yet I don't know,'\nhe went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them\nwith one eye; 'I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. \"--SAID\nI COULD NOT SWIM--\" you can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the\nKnave.\n\nThe Knave shook his head sadly. 'Do I look like it?' he said. (Which he\ncertainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)\n\n'All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering over\nthe verses to himself: '\"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--\" that's the jury, of\ncourse--\"I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--\" why, that must be what he\ndid with the tarts, you know--'\n\n'But, it goes on \"THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,\"' said Alice.\n\n'Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts\non the table. 'Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then again--\"BEFORE SHE\nHAD THIS FIT--\" you never had fits, my dear, I think?' he said to the\nQueen.\n\n'Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard\nas she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his\nslate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily\nbegan again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as\nit lasted.)\n\n'Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round the court\nwith a smile. There was a dead silence.\n\n'It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed,\n'Let the jury consider their verdict,' the King said, for about the\ntwentieth time that day.\n\n'No, no!' said the Queen. 'Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'\n\n'Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. 'The idea of having the\nsentence first!'\n\n'Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.\n\n'I won't!' said Alice.\n\n'Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody\nmoved.\n\n'Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this\ntime.) 'You're nothing but a pack of cards!'\n\nAt this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon\nher: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and\ntried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her\nhead in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead\nleaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.\n\n'Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; 'Why, what a long sleep you've\nhad!'\n\n'Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told her\nsister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures\nof hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had\nfinished, her sister kissed her, and said, 'It WAS a curious dream,\ndear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.' So\nAlice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,\nwhat a wonderful dream it had been.\n\nBut her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her\nhand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her\nwonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and\nthis was her dream:--\n\nFirst, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny\nhands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking\nup into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that\nqueer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that\nWOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to\nlisten, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures\nof her little sister's dream.\n\nThe long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the\nfrightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she\ncould hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends\nshared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen\nordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby\nwas sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed\naround it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the\nLizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\nfilled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock\nTurtle.\n\nSo she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\nWonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all\nwould change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the\nwind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling\nteacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill\ncries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the\nshriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she\nknew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing\nof the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's\nheavy sobs.\n\nLastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers\nwould, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would\nkeep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her\nchildhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and\nmake THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even\nwith the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with\nall their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,\nremembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.\n\n              THE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND ***\n\n***** This file should be named 11.txt or 11.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/11/\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the\ntrademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone\nproviding copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance\nwith this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,\npromotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,\nharmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,\nthat arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do\nor cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm\nwork, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any\nProject Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.\n\n\nSection  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"},"Apple":{"title":"Apple","created":"20180222072026299","list":"[[Apple 6]] [[Apple 7]] [[Apple 8]] [[Apple 9]] [[Apple 10]] [[Apple 20]] [[Apple 30]] [[Apple 100]]","modified":"20180222072215582","tags":"","text":""},"Caruso - Ave Maria":{"title":"Caruso - Ave Maria","type":"audio/mp3","_canonical_uri":"https://archive.org/download/Caruso_part1/Caruso-AveMaria.mp3"},"GroupedLists":{"title":"GroupedLists","tags":"ListWidget Lists","created":"20150106180000000","modified":"20150221230117000","text":"The following sidebar tabs give examples of grouped lists created by nesting.\n\n!!

For a more technical presentation, see [[Filter Syntax]].\"\"\">>\n\n<$macrocall $name=\".tip\" _=\"\"\"Filters do nothing if you just type them into a tiddler on their own. They need a context. An easy way to experiment with filters is to type them into the <<.advancedsearch-tab Filter>> tab of [[Advanced Search|$:/AdvancedSearch]].\"\"\"/>\n\nThe simplest case is where you already know exactly which tiddlers you want. Type each title in double square brackets, with a space between each one and the next:\n\n> `[[Recipe book]] [[ScrambledEggs]] [[Mom's apple pie]]`\n\nYou can omit the square brackets when a title doesn't contain any spaces:\n\n> `[[Recipe book]] ScrambledEggs [[Mom's apple pie]]`\n\nThe double square brackets are actually a shorthand for this:\n\n> `[title[ScrambledEggs]]`\n\n... which gives us the <<.def \"general model\">> for any filter:\n\n> `[operator[parameter]]`\n\nFor instance, here's how to select all the tiddlers that have been tagged <<.tag Recipe>>:\n\n> `[tag[Recipe]]`\n\nWe can reverse the meaning by adding an exclamation mark `!` just before the operator. For example, we can select any tiddlers that do <<.em not>> have the <<.tag Recipe>> tag:\n\n> `[!tag[Recipe]]`\n\nTiddlers can be filtered by other fields than just title and tags:\n\n> `[field:serving[4]]`\n\nThat example will select any tiddlers that have <<.value 4>> in their <<.field serving>> field.\n\nAs the word \"serving\" isn't a standard filter operator (and isn't likely to become one), you can safely omit the `field:` prefix:\n\n> `[serving[4]]`\n\n!Combinations\n\nThe filters we've looked at so far have involved just one step each. But you can <<.def run>> several steps together like this:\n\n> `[tag[Vegetarian]!tag[soup]serving[4]]`\n\nNotice how the entire run is contained in a single pair of square brackets.\n\nA tiddler has to match <<.em all>> of the steps in a run. So the example above retrieves vegetarian recipes (other than soups) for 4 people.\n\nA sequence of separate runs will select the tiddlers that match <<.em any>> of the runs. We can use this to find recipes that serve either 3, 4 or 5 people:\n\n> `[serving[3]] [serving[4]] [serving[5]]`\n\nIf we want to ignore vegetarian recipes that serve 4, we can say this:\n\n> `[serving[3]] [serving[4]!tag[Vegetarian]] [serving[5]]`\n\nBy default, each run considers every tiddler in the wiki. But we can use a `+` sign to force a run to consider only the tiddlers that were selected by the preceding runs:\n\n> `[serving[3]] [serving[4]] [serving[5]] +[tag[Vegetarian]] +[sort[title]]`\n\nThis selects recipes for 3, 4 or 5 people, then filters <<.em those>> to keep only the vegetarian ones, and finally sorts any that are left into alphabetical order of title.\n\nIn a similar way, we can use a `-` sign to <<.em remove>> a run's tiddlers from the result so far. Here we select all vegetarian recipes apart from two:\n\n> `[tag[Vegetarian]] -[title[ScrambledEggs]] -BeansOnToast`\n\n!Special parameters\n\nThe parameter of each step we've seen so far has been in square brackets, meaning that ~TiddlyWiki treats it literally. But two other kinds of bracket are possible:\n\n<<.def \"Curly brackets\">> `{}` mean that the parameter is a TextReference, and that its value is to be looked up in a specified tiddler. For example, if we have a tiddler called <<.tid Preference>> whose text happens to be the word <<.value Vegetarian>>, we can say\n\n> `[tag{Preference}]`\n\nas an alternative to `[tag[Vegetarian]]`. This allows the preference to change over time.\n\n<<.def \"Angle brackets\">> `<>` mean that the parameter is the name of a [[variable|Variables]] whose value is to be used instead. Here we use the built-in <<.vlink currentTiddler>> variable in a filter that selects any tiddlers whose text contains the title of the current one:\n\n> `[search<currentTiddler>]`\n"},"is Operator":{"title":"is Operator","created":"20140410103123179","modified":"20161127142329969","tags":"[[Filter Operators]] [[Common Operators]] [[Negatable Operators]]","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","caption":"is","op-purpose":"filter the input by fundamental category","op-input":"a [[selection of titles|Title Selection]]","op-parameter":"a category","op-parameter-name":"C","op-output":"those input tiddlers that belong to category <<.place C>>","op-neg-output":"those input tiddlers that do <<.em not>> belong to category <<.place C>>","text":"The parameter <<.place C>> is one of the following fundamental categories:\n\n|!Category |!Matches any tiddler that... |\n|^`current` |is the [[current tiddler|Current Tiddler]] |\n|^`image` |has an image ContentType |\n|^`missing` |does not exist (other than possibly as a shadow tiddler), regardless of whether there are any links to it |\n|^`orphan` |has no [[hard links|Hard and Soft Links]] to it |\n|^`shadow` |is a [[shadow tiddler|ShadowTiddlers]], regardless of whether it has been overridden with a non-shadow tiddler |\n|^`system` |is a [[system tiddler|SystemTiddlers]], i.e. its title starts with `$:/` |\n|^`tag` |is in use as a tag |\n|^`tiddler` |exists as a non-shadow tiddler |\n\nIf <<.place C>> is anything else an error message is returned. <<.from-version \"5.1.14\">> if <<.place C>> is blank, the output is passed through unchanged (in earlier versions an error message was returned).\n\n`!is[tiddler]` is a synonym for `is[missing]`, and vice versa.\n\nWhen <<.op is[missing]>> is the first operator in a [[run|Filter Run]], its output is always empty.

This can make it hard to understand until the moment when it clicks, and becomes a seamless extension of your brain.\n\nStarting with the basics, TiddlyWiki is a note-taking web application you can download for free, store wherever you like and customise however you wish. Use it to capture, organise and share your notes in ways that word processors and other note-taking tools cannot.\n\n~TiddlyWiki is designed to be non-linear, structuring content with stories, tags, hyperlinks, and other features. You can organise and retrieve your notes in ways that conform to your personal thought patterns, rather than feel chained to one preset organisational structure.\n\nYou can use ~TiddlyWiki as a single file that you view and edit through any web browser, whether you are online or offline. Or you can use it as a powerful [[Node.js application|TiddlyWiki on Node.js]] that stores each of your notes as a separate file.\n\nHow can you make ~TiddlyWiki work for you? We recommend you start with our introductory documentation listed below, and then browse the TableOfContents, available in the Contents tab in the sidebar.

It is a tool for note-taking, bookmarking, pinning, writing, managing to-do lists and projects, collaborating, blogging, and publishing.\n\nIn ~TiddlyWiki you create or paste content into notes called tiddlers, then connect your tiddlers with hyperlinks and tags. You can then quickly retrieve your notes through features such as tag pills, sidebar tabs, and ~TiddlyWiki's lightning fast search window. You can even dynamically include one tiddler's content inside another - similar to using building blocks - to create articles, lists, presentations and more.\n\n! ~TiddlyWiki is a Toolbox\n\nIn addition to being a versatile tool, ''~TiddlyWiki is also a toolbox.''\n\nWhere other note-taking products hook you with the basic program then charge you for the really helpful features, ~TiddlyWiki has an ever-expanding collection of completely free visual themes, colour palettes, plugins, widgets and macros, which you can then mix and match so that you can tweak and tailor your ~TiddlyWiki to get it just the way you want it. \n\n! ~TiddlyWiki is also a Community\n\nWe are a [[community|Community]] of users and developers who help each other imagine new ways of thinking and organising and create new solutions, so that ~TiddlyWiki is continually adapting to better serve your needs. ~TiddlyWiki users and developers share questions and advice at a ~TiddlyWiki Google group. They also create tutorials, adaptations, and plugins to enhance your ~TiddlyWiki experience. See the section ''Community'' of the TableOfContents for more details.\n\n! Finally, ~TiddlyWiki is a philosophy\n\nThe purpose of taking and organising a note (or recording any kind of content) is to be able to retrieve it later. If you can't find your notes in your note-taking system, your note-taking becomes a colossal waste of time.\n\nThe [[TiddlyWiki philosophy|Philosophy of Tiddlers]] is that the best way to take notes is to separate them into tiddlers, the smallest semantic units possible. A tiddler might be an image, a webpage link, a concept, the definition of a term, or a specific customisation such as a macro.\n\nThese tiddlers can then be woven together to create longer units: stories, articles, lists, image galleries, and much more. ~TiddlyWiki's features such as tagging, hyperlinking, and filters are specially designed to help you relate and connect tiddlers together in multiple ways, facilitating your future retrieval of your notes and even helping you see unexpected relationships among your tiddlers and the information they contain.\n"},"HelloThere":{"title":"HelloThere","created":"20130822170200000","list":"[[A Gentle Guide to TiddlyWiki]] [[Discover TiddlyWiki]] [[Some of the things you can do with TiddlyWiki]] [[Ten reasons to switch to TiddlyWiki]] Examples [[What happened to the original TiddlyWiki?]] [[HelloThumbnail - TWEUM2017]]","modified":"20180512104329616","tags":"TableOfContents","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","text":"''Have you ever had the feeling that your head is not quite big enough to hold everything you need to remember?''\n\nWelcome to TiddlyWiki, a unique [[non-linear|Philosophy of Tiddlers]] notebook for [[capturing|Creating and editing tiddlers]], [[organising|Structuring TiddlyWiki]] and [[sharing|Sharing your tiddlers with others]] complex information.\n\nUse it to keep your [[to-do list|TaskManagementExample]], to plan an [[essay or novel|\"TiddlyWiki for Scholars\" by Alberto Molina]], or to organise your wedding.

This process in some programming languages is often referred to as \"concatenating\" text.\n\nYou might, for instance want to set up a template for your customer database, where links will automatically refer to additional contact information about your customer. Inside your tiddler, you might try something like this:\n\n\n|warning|k\n|@@font-size:1.5em;&#9888;@@ Warning:<br/> Don't do it this way!| `[[Additional Info|<<currentTiddler>>-Contact]]` |\n\nBut that won't work. If you try this, the link will be interpreted very literally, and will attempt to take you to:\n\n```\n<<currentTiddler>>-Contact\n```\n\nThe solution is to use a macro to put the rendered value of `<<currentTiddler>>` together with the bit of additional text, `-Contact`.\n\nCreate a macro either at the top of the tiddler or in a global tiddler (see [[Macros]]) like this:\n\n```\n\\define linkup(link) [[Additional Info|$link$-Contact]]\n```\n\nYou might be tempted to invoke the new macro like this:\n\n|warning|k\n|@@font-size:1.5em;&#9888;@@ Warning:<br/> Don't do it this way!| `<<linkup <<currentTiddler>> >>` |\n\n\nBut if you do, you will find that `<<currentTiddler>>` doesn't get rendered, but instead gets passed literally.\n\nInstead, you could use the [[MacroCallWidget]] widget, like this:\n\n```\n<$macrocall $name=\"linkup\" link=<<currentTiddler>> />\n```\n\nIn this case, we passed the value of a variable directly to our macro. This is often a general way to go about this task. If you wanted to create more links based on other variables you could re-use the macro for each situation.\n\nIf, as in this case, the only variable you are using is `currentTiddler` then you could write a simple macro, like this:\n\n```\n\\define linkup() [[Additional Info|$(currentTiddler)$-Contact]]\n```\n\nNotice that in this case we don't pass an argument. Instead, we reference the variable using the special syntax `$(variable)$`.  Since we don't pass an argument, we can invoke it without the `<$macrocall>` widget more simply, like this:\n\n```\n<<linkup>>\n```\n\n<style>\n.warning code  {background-color:#ffff80}\ntable.warning {background-color:#ffff80;}\n\n</style>\n"},"Configuring the default TiddlerInfo tab":{"title":"Configuring the default TiddlerInfo tab","created":"20140828080837703","modified":"20140912145908651","tags":"[[Customise TiddlyWiki]]","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","text":"The configuration tiddler [[$:/config/TiddlerInfo/Default]] contains the title of the tiddler containing the default tiddler info tab.\n\nThe default value is `$:/core/ui/TiddlerInfo/Tools` corresponding to the ''Tools'' tab.

The following scenarios are all illustrated on https://tiddlywiki.com.\n\n! Wiki Snapshots and Tiddler Snapshots\n\nYou can explore a static representation of this TiddlyWiki at [ext[static.html]]. That file is a static snapshot of the current DefaultTiddlers. Any tiddlers that it links to are referred to via URLs of the form `/static/HelloThere.html` that point to static snapshots of individual tiddlers. The tiddler HTML files reference a `static.css` stylesheet file.\n\nThe following commands are used to generate the sample static version of the TiddlyWiki5 site:\n\n```\n--rendertiddlers [!is[system]] $:/core/templates/static.tiddler.html static text/plain\n--rendertiddler $:/core/templates/static.template.html static.html text/plain\n--rendertiddler $:/core/templates/static.template.css static/static.css text/plain\n```\n\nThe first RenderTiddlersCommand generates the HTML representations of individual tiddlers, the second RenderTiddlerCommand saves the static version of the DefaultTiddlers, and the final RenderTiddlerCommand saves the stylesheet. (All the files are placed in the `output` folder of the wiki folder).\n\n! Wiki Snapshot with Internal Links\n\nIt is also possible to produce a single HTML file that contains static representations of tiddlers, and uses standard HTML anchor links to jump between them.\n\nFor example: [ext[alltiddlers.html]]\n\nThe example is built by the following commands:\n\n```\n--rendertiddler $:/core/templates/alltiddlers.template.html alltiddlers.html text/plain\n```\n"},"Hard Linebreaks with CSS":{"title":"Hard Linebreaks with CSS","created":"20170126174506507","modified":"20170126211042714","tags":"[[Hard Linebreaks in WikiText]]","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","text":"Since TiddlyWiki Version 5.1.16, it's possible to apply customs styles with `data-` attributes. see: [[How to apply custom styles]]\n\nThe [[Custom data-styles]] stylesheet tiddler contains the following definition:\n\n```\n[data-tags*=\"example-hardlinebreaks\"] .tc-tiddler-body {\n  word-break: normal; \n  word-wrap: break-word;\n  white-space: pre-wrap;\n}\n```\n\nIf rendered without the tag, the content of \"Hard Linebreaks with CSS - Example\" will be shown like this: \n\n>{{Hard Linebreaks with CSS - Example}}\n\n----\n\nOpen the tiddler to see the custom CSS rules applied: [[Hard Linebreaks with CSS - Example]]\n\n"},"Hard Linebreaks with CSS - Example":{"title":"Hard Linebreaks with CSS - Example","created":"20170126161803543","modified":"20170126211025840","tags":"example-hardlinebreaks [[Hard Linebreaks in WikiText]]","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","text":"The following text is rendered without any special WikiText syntax.

Also see: [[How to apply custom styles]]\n\n----\n\nYou can apply custom styles to tiddlers that have a particular tag by defining a CSS class with the name `tc-tagged-<Tag Name>`.\n\nFor example, to make tiddlers tagged \"NightReader\" appear in a special colour scheme suitable for night-time reading, [[create a stylesheet|Using Stylesheets]] defining the class `tc-tagged-NightReader` like this:\n\n```\n.tc-tagged-NightReader {\n\tbackground-color:black;\n\tcolor: orange;\n\tpadding: 35px 35px;\n}\n\n.tc-tagged-NightReader .tc-tiddler-body {\n\tfont-size: 1.5em;\n}\n```\n\nThe `tc-tagged-NightReader` class is applied to the entire tiddler and not just the tiddler text. If you want to target a smaller portion of the tiddler you can qualify the CSS selector, as is done here with `.tc-tagged-NightReader .tc-tiddler-body`.\n\nNote that tags containing spaces or non-alphanumeric characters will be converted using URI encoding, making the generated CSS classname hard to predict. For example:\n\n|!Tag |!Generated Class Name |\n|`$:/mytag` |`tc-tagged-%24%3A%2Fmytag` |\n|`Doctor Who` |`tc-tagged-Doctor%20Who` |\n|`£35.23` |`tc-tagged-%C2%A335.23` |\n\nAlthough ~TiddlyWiki will generate these tags, to actually use them in your css, you will need to escape the percent character in your stylesheet, like:\n\n```\n.tc-tagged-Doctor\\%20Who {\n    background-image: url(./tardis_back.svg);\n    background-repeat: no-repeat;\n    background-position: right;\n    color:#FBFBFB;\n}\n```\n\nA utility function is available in JavaScript to perform the conversion:\n\n```\n$tw.utils.tagToCssSelector(\"$:/tags/Stylesheet\")\n```\n\nGenerates the following output:\n\n```\ntc-tagged-\\%24\\%3A\\%2Ftags\\%2FStylesheet\n```\n\n"},"How to apply custom styles":{"title":"How to apply custom styles","created":"20141001132300000","list":"[[Custom styles by data-tags]] [[Custom styles by title]]","modified":"201804111740","tags":"[[Customise TiddlyWiki]]","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","text":"At the moment there are several ways to apply custom styles.\n\n<<list-links filter:\"[tag[How to apply custom styles]]\">>\n"},"How to build a TiddlyWiki5 from individual tiddlers":{"title":"How to build a TiddlyWiki5 from individual tiddlers","created":"20131124220600000","modified":"20140912141637389","tags":"[[TiddlyWiki on Node.js]]","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","text":"First install TiddlyWiki as described in [[Installing TiddlyWiki on Node.js]].\n\n# Create an empty [[TiddlyWikiFolder|TiddlyWikiFolders]]\n## Create a new folder in a convenient place (for example `~/MyWiki`)\n## Create a file called `tiddlywiki.info` containing the following text:\n##* `{\"themes\": [\"tiddlywiki/vanilla\",\"tiddlywiki/snowwhite\"]}`\n## Create a subfolder called `tiddlers`\n##* Alternatively, just copy the `editions/empty` folder from the TiddlyWiki5 repo\n# Create individual TiddlerFiles in the `~/MyWiki/tiddlers` directory\n# Execute the following command from the TiddlyWiki5 root directory to build a TiddlyWiki5 file from the tiddlers:\n## `tiddlywiki ~/MyWiki --rendertiddler $:/core/save/all index.html text/plain`\n"},"How to change the sort order of sub-branches in a TOC macro":{"title":"How to change the sort order of sub-branches in a TOC macro","created":"20161209172820513","modified":"20161209174234840","tags":"Learning","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","text":"Imagine that you are using a [[Table of Contents|Table-of-Contents Macros]] macro similar to this:\n\n```\n<<toc-selective-expandable  \"TableOfContents\" \"sort[title]\" >>\n```\n\nThe sorting is fine for most cases, but you would like all your items tagged `Journal` to be sorted by the `created` field. How can you apply a separate sort order to just those sub-items tagged `Journal`?\n\nThe trick is to add a field to the parent tagging tiddler (i.e. `Journal`) that points to a different sort criteria. Let's call the field `fuzzy`, and populate it with the value `created` (`created `is the name of the field that contains a tiddler's creation date).\n\nNow change your [[Table of Contents|Table-of-Contents Macros]] to look like this:\n\n```\n<<toc-selective-expandable  \"TableOfContents\" \"sort{fuzzy}\" >>\n```\n\nNow your Table of Contents will sort by title everywhere, except for the children of the `Journal` tiddler, which will sort by the `created `date.\n\nThe downside to this trick is that you can't apply a reverse sort based on just one special field.

The advantage to this approach is that it is simple and quick. The disadvantage is that the file doesn't actually travel with the TW5 file and that you can't use `node.js` with method #2 below to quickly file paths.\n\n!! Two ways to embed a PDF in your TW5 file.\n\n!!! 1. Embedding with Drag and Drop \n\nOne is to drag and drop the file onto your TW5 file. Wait for the green bar to appear at the top, drop, and then import from the import tiddler. This actually embeds the contents of your imported PDF (or other file) into your TW5 file.\n\nThis method be OK as long as your PDF is not too big. There can be concerns if your TW5 file becomes too big.\n\n!!! 2. Embedding with '_canonical_uri'\n\nThe other way is to create a tiddler link to the external file. In this method the file is not actually incorporated into your TW5 file, but can be accessed with the `{{My Image File.jpg}}` transclusion syntax just like an embedded file. The location address of the file can also be changed under [[node.js]]. See [[ExternalImages]] for details of using external images with node.js.\n\nCreate a tiddler with a field `_canonical_uri`. Put in the local address to the external file. Set the `type` field to `application/pdf`.\n\nWith either way, with an appropriately configured browser, you should see your embedded PDF file. \n\n!!! Other File Types\n\nThere's only so many file formats that TW5 knows about. There is a list at [[ContentType]]. If your browser and/or TW5 doesn't know what to do with a particular file format, then you can only the use the second method to embed and then download a file. When you edit the tiddler a link is presented. You can right click on the link in order to download the file.\n"},"How to export tiddlers":{"title":"How to export tiddlers","created":"20151006145934884","modified":"20160610084018658","tags":"Learning","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","text":"!

You can add any number of tags to the same tiddler.\n\nSee [[Creating and editing tiddlers]] for instructions on how to tag.\n\nBy tagging your tiddlers, you can view, navigate and organise your information in numerous additional ways:\n\n* The coloured tag pills on a tiddler give you quick access to all the other tiddlers with the same tag, as well as to the tiddler that represents the tag itself.\n\n* If a tiddler is serving as a tag, then the ''Tagging'' tab in its InfoPanel will show you which tiddlers are currently tagged with it.\n\n* The ''More'' tab of the sidebar has a ''Tags'' tab that presents an overview of all your tags and lets you access all your tagged tiddlers.\n\n* You can use [[filters|Filters]] to create lists of tiddlers based on their tags. You can then display any combination of the [[fields|TiddlerFields]] of those tiddlers. For example, you could build a glossary by listing the title and text of all tiddlers tagged ''Glossary''. Such lists can be formatted in any way you wish: e.g. bulleted, numbered or comma-separated.\n\n* There are a number of special ''system tags'' that control the layout of tiddlers and the entire ~TiddlyWiki page. See [[Page and tiddler layout customisation]] for instructions.\n\nThere are two more things you can do with tags:\n\n! Set a tag's colour and icon\n\nYou can use the {{$:/core/images/tag-button}} [[tag manager|$:/TagManager]], found on the ''Tags'' tab under ''More'' in the sidebar, to change the colour of a tag's pill or add an icon to the pill.\n\n* To change the colour, click the button in the ''Colour'' column to select from a colour picker.

Change the order in which tags are listed\n\nBy default, tagged tiddlers are listed in alphabetical order.\n\nIf you want any other order, add a <<.flink ListField>> field to the tag tiddler, and set its value to be a [[list of the tiddlers|Title List]] in that order.\n\nThe ''list'' field doesn't have to mention all of the tiddlers.

Every care is taken in TiddlyWiki's development to ensure that it is a safe place to preserve your most valuable data but the ultimate responsibility to reduce the risk of data loss falls to users.\n\nThe best way to make sure that your data is safe is to practise a rigorous system of backups:\n\n* Consider using services like Dropbox to continuously back up your personal data to the cloud. (Dropbox [[has a neat feature|https://www.dropbox.com/help/11]] whereby they keep track of previous versions of files)\n* Retain backups before upgrading to a new version of TiddlyWiki\n* Figure out and protect yourself from the worst case scenarios: what if your USB stick or hard drive fails? What if your computer is hit by a ransomeware virus?\n* Be defensive and redundant: for example, take multiple backups and keep them in separate physical locations\n"},"Upgrading":{"title":"Upgrading","created":"20131202102427114","modified":"20160617105124677","tags":"Features [[Working with TiddlyWiki]]","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","text":"There are regular releases of TiddlyWiki with bug fixes and improvements. It's a good idea to keep up to date by regularly upgrading to the latest version.\n\n! Introduction\n\nThe process described here is for upgrading standalone TiddlyWiki files. There is a [[different procedure|Upgrading TiddlyWiki on Node.js]] for upgrading [[TiddlyWiki on Node.js]].\n\n<<<\nWhen upgrading, please remember the [[The First Rule of Using TiddlyWiki]]:\n\n//You are responsible for looking after your own data; take care to make backups, especially when upgrading the ~TiddlyWiki core//\n<<<\n\n! Online upgrading\n\nThis process will work on most desktop browsers. Note that none of your personal data leaves your browser with this process.\n\n# Locate your TiddlyWiki file in the file system (i.e. using Windows Explorer, the Finder on Mac OS X, or your file manager on Linux)\n# Visit https://tiddlywiki.com/upgrade.html in your browser\n\n# Drag your old TiddlyWiki HTML file into the browser window\n#* If the file is encrypted you will be prompted for the password\n# Review the list of tiddlers that will be upgraded\n# Click ''Upgrade''\n# Save changes to save the new version ({{$:/core/images/save-button}})\n\nThis will download a file called ''upgrade.html'' to your computer. This file is the upgrade of your old file. You may need to open the location where ''upgrade.html'' was downloaded, rename ''upgrade.html'' with the name of the old file you are upgrading, and replace the old file by moving the new file in its place.\n\n! Offline upgrading\n\nYou can also download https://tiddlywiki.com/upgrade.html locally and perform the same drag-and-drop procedure to upgrade your files.\n\n! Problems with Upgrades\n\n!! Firefox Security Restrictions\n\nThe following error occurs when trying to perform the online upgrade procedure using Firefox:\n\n<<<\nError while saving:\n\nError:NS_ERROR_DOM_BAD_URI: Access to restricted URI denied\n<<<\n\nThe upgrade operation falls foul of a security restriction in Firefox. Until this can be resolved, we suggest either using the offline upgrader, or using Chrome to perform the upgrade:\n\n# Use Chrome to open https://tiddlywiki.com/upgrade.html, then drag the TiddlyWiki HTML file to be upgraded into the upgrader window, as described above in ''Online upgrading''\n# After you've saved your upgraded file, you should be able to open it in Firefox and [[save using TiddlyFox|Saving with TiddlyFox]] again\n\n!! Incompatible Customisations\n\nIt is possible for a customisation applied in a previous version to break when upgraded to the latest version. There are two techniques you can use to help track down issues:\n\n* Try repeating the upgrade having selectively unchecked any tiddlers that may be applying customisations to TiddlyWiki\n* Use SafeMode to disable all customisations of shadow tiddlers\n\nYou can see which shadow tiddlers have been overridden in the ''Filter'' tab of [[advanced search|$:/AdvancedSearch]].

For example, `html body.tc-body` is more specific than `body.tc-body`. \n\n<<.tip \"''You should always start with the least specific value that works!''<br><br>\">>\n\n! Stylesheet Types\n\nUsually it is best to use the type `text/css` for stylesheets. This treats them as plain stylesheets, and ensures that ~TiddlyWiki doesn't apply any wiki processing to them.\n\nIf you wish to use macros and transclusions in your stylesheets you should instead use the default WikiText type `text/vnd.tiddlywiki`. This allows full ~WikiText processing to be performed. Here is an example:\n\n```\n\\rules only filteredtranscludeinline transcludeinline macrodef macrocallinline html\n\nbody.tc-body pre {\n\t<<box-shadow \"inset 0 1px 0 #fff\">>\n}\n```\n\nThe `\\rules` pragma at the top of the tiddler restricts the ~WikiText to just allow macros and transclusion. This avoids mistakenly triggering unwanted ~WikiText processing.\n\nA stylesheet tiddler is processed such that it is first wikified and then the text portion of the ouput is extracted to apply as the CSS. Any HTML tags you will use in your stylesheet are thus ignored. For example, HTML elements generated by the RevealWidget will not affect the output. As in the following example, you can wrap CSS rules in `<pre>` tags to display them as a codeblock without affecting processing, including handling the inner macro.\n\n```\n\\rules only filteredtranscludeinline transcludeinline macrodef macrocallinline html\n\n<pre>body.tc-body pre {\n\t<<box-shadow \"inset 0 1px 0 #fff\">>\n}\n</pre>\n```\n\n!! Stylesheet Macros\n\nThe ~TiddlyWiki core provides several [[global macros that are helpful in constructing stylesheets|Stylesheet Macros]].\n"},"Using SVG":{"title":"Using SVG","created":"20131028132700000","modified":"20160618085859219","tags":"Features","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","text":"TiddlyWiki5 allows you to use SVG to display vector graphics in two ways:\n\n* Tiddlers with the type `image/svg+xml` are interpreted as SVG images, and displayed and transcluded as self-contained `<img>` elements with the SVG embedded as a data URI in the `src` attribute.\n** For examples of SVG images see [[Motovun Jack.svg]] and [[Tiddler Fishes.svg]]\n* WikiText can also include inline SVG elements directly. See below for an example.\n\n! Embedding SVG tiddlers\n\nYou can embed an SVG image tiddler using the ordinary transclusion syntax:\n\n```\n{{Motovun Jack.jpg}}\n```\n\nYou can also use [[Typed Blocks in WikiText]] to embed an inline SVG tiddler.\n\nThe implications of the image being rendered within an `<img>` element are that it is sandboxed; it can't use CSS styles from the parent document, for example. Neither can the image use WikiText features like transclusion.\n\n! Embedding SVG elements\n\nThe other way to use SVG is to embed the `<svg>` element directly. For example:\n\n<svg width=\"150\" height=\"100\">\n  <circle cx=\"100\" cy=\"50\" r=\"40\" stroke=\"black\" stroke-width=\"2\" fill=\"red\" />\n</svg>\n\nNote that inline SVG elements don't need an `<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>` directive.\n\n! Including HTML or WikiText content in SVG images\n\nYou can include simple text strings in SVG images using the `<text>` element:\n\n<svg width=\"100px\" height=\"30px\" viewBox=\"0 0 1000 300\"><text x=\"250\" y=\"150\" font-family=\"Verdana\" font-size=\"55\">Hello, out there</text><rect x=\"1\" y=\"1\" width=\"998\" height=\"298\" fill=\"none\" stroke-width=\"2\" /></svg>\n\nHTML or WikiText content can be included within inline SVG images using the `<foreignObject>` element. For example:\n\n<svg width=\"260px\" height=\"260px\"><circle cx=\"150\" cy=\"150\" r=\"100\" fill=\"blue\" stoke=\"red\"/><foreignObject x=\"70\" y=\"110\" width=\"150\" height=\"180\"><body>Here is some text that requires a word wrap, and includes a [[link to a tiddler|HelloThere]].</body></foreignObject></svg>\n\n! Transcluding SVG elements\n\nWhen embedding SVG elements you can also use WikiText features like transclusion. For example, here is an SVG circle with the radius set to the value in the tiddler [[$:/SVGExampleRadius]]:\n\n<svg width=\"150\" height=\"150\"><circle cx=\"75\" cy=\"75\" r={{$:/SVGExampleRadius}} stroke=\"black\" stroke-width=\"2\" fill=\"green\"/></svg>\n\nYou can edit the value of the radius here: <$edit-text tiddler=\"$:/SVGExampleRadius\" tag=\"input\"/>\n\n!

It lets you maintain a single set of documentation as a [[TiddlyWikiFolder|TiddlyWikiFolders]] containing separate tiddler files under source code control, and then use it to produce `readme.md` files for inclusion in project folders, or HTML files for storage in [[GitHub Pages|http://pages.github.com/]]. Both features are demonstrated by TiddlyWiki5 itself.\n\n! Generating `readme.md` files\n\nWhen displaying the contents of a folder GitHub will look for a `readme.md` file and display it. Note that it will not display full HTML files in this way, just static MarkDown files (this is a security measure). Happily MarkDown permits a safe subset of HTML, and thus to generate a `readme.md` file that is suitable for GitHub it is just necessary for TiddlyWiki5 to generate the content of the `<body>` element of an HTML document, and give it the appropriate filename.\n\nThis is done with this command:\n\n```\n--rendertiddler ReadMe ./readme.md text/html\n```\n\nIt saves the tiddler ReadMe to the file `./readme.md` in the `text/html` format.\n\nBy default, tiddler links will be rendered as `<a>` links to a relative URI consisting of the title of the tiddler. This behaviour can be overridden by defining the macro `tv-wikilink-template`, as is done at the top of the tiddler ReadMe:\n\n```\n\\define tv-wikilink-template() https://tiddlywiki.com/static/$uri_doubleencoded$.html\n```\n\nSee the LinkWidget for more details.\n\nIn this example, tiddler links are rendered as links to the static rendering of tw5.com.\n"},"Windows HTA Hack":{"title":"Windows HTA Hack","caption":"HTA Hack","created":"20131212223146250","delivery":"DIY","description":"Manual method to let Internet Explorer save changes directly","method":"save","modified":"20171113160539299","tags":"Saving Windows","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","text":"Under Windows it is possible to convert TiddlyWiki into a true local application by renaming the HTML file to have the extension `*.hta`. The ''fsosaver'' module can then use the ~ActiveX ~FileSystemObject to save changes.\n\nNote that one disadvantage of this approach is that the TiddlyWiki file is saved in UTF-16 format, making it up to twice as large as it would be with the usual UTF-8 encoding.

The following is a brief run-through of some of the more common techniques.\n\n~TiddlyWiki [[uses|The Extended Listops Filters]] lists [[internally|ListField]] for many purposes so the word can have several meanings. Here we are concerned with displaying sequences of items, but not necessarily presented as a conventional bullet list.\n\n! Manually Typed Lists\n\n!! ~WikiText\n\nWikiText lists are manually typed lists that use a special character to specify what sort of list it is and how it should be displayed.\n\nExamples include bullet lists created with asterisks (*) and numbered lists (#). Behind the scenes, ~WikiText lists are based on the standard `<ul>` and `<li>` HTML elements. For more information see [[Lists in WikiText]].\n\nAn example of a typed list in WikiText:\n\n<<wikitext-example-without-html \"\"\"* Greatest Movies of All Time\n** Casa Blanca\n** Pride and Prejudice and Zombies\"\"\">>\n\n! Generated Lists\n\nLists can be automatically generated with the ListWidget using [[filters|Filters]] in which [[filter operators|Filter Operators]] \nspecify criteria for selecting which tiddlers are desired as output. Shortcut macros are provided for some common types of list.\n\n!! ~ListWidget\n\nThe ListWidget is the most powerful tool for creating lists. It allows the filtered output to be manipulated and styled into forms that may not seem to resemble lists at all, for example tables or complex texts. For more details, see [[ListWidget]].\n\nAn example to show all tiddlers tagged with \"HelloThere\" might look like:\n\n<<wikitext-example-without-html \"\"\"<$list filter=\"[tag[HelloThere]]\"><$view field=\"title\"/><br/></$list>\"\"\">>\n\n<<.tip \"\"\"Even tiddlers themselves are made with the ~ListWidget. The [[ViewTemplate|$:/core/ui/ViewTemplate]] makes use of the ListWidget to fetch all specified templates that are used to show a tiddlers title, tags, text and more.\"\"\">>\n\n!! Filtered transclusion\n\nThe syntax for filtered transclusion `{{{...}}}` takes a filter as input and outputs a linked list of matching titles. You can also apply a [[template|Transclusion with Templates]], for example:\n\n<<wikitext-example-without-html \"\"\"{{{ [tag[HelloThere]] || $:/core/ui/TagTemplate }}}\"\"\">>\n\n!! list-links Macro\n\nThe [[list-links|list-links Macro]] macro gives a preformatted list, typically a bullet list, in a more simplified way than by using the ListWidget. Behind the scenes it really is the ListWidget applying a default template to each list item.\n\n<$macrocall $name=\"wikitext-example-without-html\" src=\"\"\"<<list-links \"[tag[HelloThere]]\">>\"\"\"/>\n\n!Other “list related” features\n\n[[list|ListField]], [[list-before|Order of Tagged Tiddlers]] and [[list-after|Order of Tagged Tiddlers]] are all field names to control the position of tiddlers in a list. [[Fields|TiddlerFields]] are a way to add additional bits of structured information to a tiddler such as date, quantity, category, etc.\n\n[[list|list Operator]] and [[listed|listed Operator]] are //filter operators// to, respectively, select and find titles in lists.\n"},"Learning":{"title":"Learning","created":"20140912140047779","list":"Videos [[Introduction to filter notation]] [[Sharing a TiddlyWiki on Dropbox]] [[Sharing your tiddlers with others]] [[Copying tiddlers between TiddlyWiki files]] [[Creating SubStories]] [[Editing Tiddlers with Emacs]] [[ImageGallery Example]] [[Making curved text with SVG]] TaskManagementExample [[Adding a Twitter Follow button]] [[Philosophy of Tiddlers]] [[Adopt a Titles Policy]]","modified":"20140919161721584","tags":"TableOfContents","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","text":"Learn more about using TiddlyWiki:\n\n<<list-links \"[tag[Learning]]\">>\n\nAlso see the complete [[Reference]], including advanced WikiText, macros, widgets, filters etc.\n"},"License":{"title":"License","created":"20170127221457627","modified":"20170127222646488","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","tags":"About","text":"TiddlyWiki is published under a [[permissive BSD 3-Clause License|https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause]] stored in the [[shadow tiddler|ShadowTiddlers]] [[$:/core/copyright.txt]]:\n\n<div style=\"font-size: 0.5em;line-height:1.4;\">\n\n{{$:/core/copyright.txt}}\n\n</div>\n\nIn layman's terms, the license says that you can take TiddlyWiki and do anything you want with it without any license fee payment or other legal obligation to the creators of TiddlyWiki or anyone else.

Structure\n\nThe top level of the tree consists of the tiddlers that carry a particular tag, known as the <<.def \"root tag\">>. Tiddlers tagged with any of those make up the next level down, and so on.\n\nAt each level, the tiddlers can be [[ordered|Order of Tagged Tiddlers]] by means of the <<.field list>> field of the parent tag tiddler. They can also be ordered by the macro's <<.param sort>> parameter.\n\nThe tree displays the <<.field caption>> field of a tiddler if it has one, or the tiddler's title otherwise.\n\nEach tiddler in the tree is normally displayed as a link. To suppress this, give the tiddler a <<.field toc-link>> field with the the value <<.value no>>. In the [[examples|Table-of-Contents Macros (Examples)]], the SecondThree tiddler is set up like this. Clicking such a tiddler in the tree causes its branch to expand or collapse.\n\nThe table of contents is generated as an HTML ordered list. The `<ol>` elements always have the class `tc-toc`. Expandable trees have the additional class `tc-toc-expandable`. Selectively expandable trees (including those in the two-panel browser) have `tc-toc-selective-expandable`.\n\nTo make a table of contents appear in the sidebar, see [[How to add a new tab to the sidebar]].\n\n!!

Plugins that are part of the core TiddlyWiki distribution have titles of the form `$:/plugins/tiddlywiki/name`.\n\nWhen [[running TiddlyWiki under Node.js|TiddlyWiki on Node.js]], plugins can also be stored as individual tiddler files in [[PluginFolders]].\n\n!

It is different from the sync mechanism, which is concerned with synchronising changes to individual tiddlers back to a server (see https://tiddlywiki.com/dev/#SyncAdaptorModules for more details).\n\nThe following steps are involved:\n\n# The saver mechanism uses the filter defined in $:/config/SaverFilter to specify which modified tiddlers trigger the dirty state for the wiki. (The dirty state is reflected in the red colouring of the \"save changes\" button in the sidebar).\n# The ButtonWidget is used to generate a [[tm-save-wiki|WidgetMessage: tm-save-wiki]] message to trigger the save operation\n# The optional parameter for the message specifies the template that will be used for generating the HTML file, defaulting to $:/core/save/all\n#* The plugin $:/plugins/tiddlywiki/tiddlyweb in the client-server configuration replaces the default template with $:/plugins/tiddlywiki/tiddlyweb/save/offline\n# The template includes a variable assignment that specifies a filter to select the tiddlers that should be included in the saved file. It then transcludes the main page template `$:/core/templates/tiddlywiki5.html`\n#* The template includes a reference to `$(publishFilter)$` that allows the filter to be customised via a global variable\n# The [[tm-save-wiki|WidgetMessage: tm-save-wiki]] handler renders the template to generate the HTML file\n# The message handler chooses the highest priority \"saver\" module that can handle saving the file\n#* See https://tiddlywiki.com/dev/#Saver for more details\n"},"StateMechanism":{"title":"StateMechanism","created":"20131228164411884","modified":"20150221225557000","tags":"Mechanisms","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","text":"The StateMechanism in TiddlyWiki is at the heart of how complex user interfaces can be built from WikiText.\n\nIn the browser, the TiddlyWiki display is produced by dynamically rendering the tiddler [[$:/core/ui/PageTemplate]]. Through various transclusions and other widgets it renders the entire user interface. The dynamic rendering is accomplished by a mechanism called \"binding\": any changes to the tiddlers in the store are dynamically reflected in the browser display.\n\nThe stack of templates that make up the TiddlyWiki display are complex but we'll focus on the line that displays the main story column:\n\n```\n<$list filter=\"[list[$:/StoryList]]\" history=\"$:/HistoryList\" template=\"$:/core/ui/ViewTemplate\" editTemplate=\"$:/core/ui/EditTemplate\" storyview={{$:/view}} />\n```\n\nBreaking down the attributes applied to the list widget:\n\n* ''filter'': selects the list of tiddlers in the `list` field of the tiddler [[$:/StoryList]]. If a tiddler is added or removed from that list then it is automatically reflected in the displayed list\n* ''history'': references the tiddler to be used to store the history stack (see the NavigationMechanism)\n* ''template'': identifies a template tiddler to be used for rendering each tiddler in the list\n* ''editTemplate'': identifies a different template tiddler to be used for rendering tiddlers that are in [[draft mode|DraftMechanism]]\n* ''storyview'': specifies the story view to be used (eg classic, or zoomin)\n\nThe [[$:/StoryList]] tiddler is an example of a StateTiddler: a tiddler that is used to hold the state of the user interface. Changes to the user interface are made indirectly, by changing the underlying state tiddlers, and letting TiddlyWiki ripple the changes through the user interface.\n\nNote how this approach makes the ''open'' tab in the sidebar very easy to implement: it is just another list widget referencing the same state tiddler, but with a different template:\n\n```\n<$list filter=\"[list[$:/StoryList]]\" history=\"$:/HistoryList\" storyview=\"pop\">\n<$button message=\"tm-close-tiddler\" class=\"tc-btn-invisible tc-btn-mini\">&times;</$button> <$link to={{!!title}}><$view field=\"title\"/></$link>\n</$list>\n```\n\nNow consider the implementation of the info panel within the tiddler template. We want to be able to toggle the info panel open and closed, which means that we must track its current state in a tiddler.\n\nHowever, we can't track the state in a tiddler called, say, [[$:/InfoPanelState]] because every tiddler would share the same state; changing the value of the tiddler would affect all tiddlers displayed in the story.\n\nThe solution is to dynamically generate a unique title for each state tiddler that we need. We need to ensure that the same state tiddler title is generated each time a user interface element is rendered. To do that, we append together tokens representating each of the stack of transclusions that led to the current rendering location. Then that string of symbols is hashed to a simple numeric value.\n\nThe process of generating a state tiddler title is encapsulated in the <<.mlink qualify>> macro.\n"},"TranslationMechanism":{"title":"TranslationMechanism","created":"20140217173700918","modified":"20140911183846401","tags":"Mechanisms","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","text":"The translation mechanism of TiddlyWiki manages and switches between language plugins that provide translations of the TiddlyWiki user interface.

Newly created tiddlers are matched to each filter in turn, and the first output of the first filter to produce any output is taken as a logical path to be used for the tiddler file. Logical paths don't include the `.tid` extension, and they can use `/` or `\\` as directory separator (when generating the physical path, this is replaced by the correct separator for the platform ~TiddlyWiki is running on). If none of the filters matches, the logical path is simply the title with all occurences of `/` replaced by `_` (for backwards compatibility).\n\nIn both cases, the characters `<>:\"\\|?*^` are replaced by `_` in order to guarantee that the resulting path is legal on all supported platforms.\n\n!! Example\n\n```\n[is[system]removeprefix[$:/]addprefix[_system/]]\n[tag[task]addprefix[mytasks/]]\n[!has[draft.of]]\n```\n\nThis will store newly created system tiddlers in `tiddlers/_system` (after stripping the `$:/` prefix), tiddlers tagged [[task]] in a subdirectory `tiddlers/mytasks`, and also create subdirectory structures for all other non-draft tiddlers.\n\nThus, $:/config/FileSystemPaths itself will end up in `tiddlers/_system/config/FileSystemPaths.tid` or `tiddlers\\_system\\config\\FileSystemPaths.tid`, depending on the platform.\n\nThe final `[!has[draft.of]]` will match all remaining non-draft tiddlers. Because there was a match, any `/` or `\\` in the tiddler title is mapped to a path separator. Thus, `some/thing/entirely/new` will be saved to `tiddlers/some/thing/entirely/new.tid` (ie, the file `new.tid` in a directory called `entirely`).\n"},"Environment Variables on Node.js":{"title":"Environment Variables on Node.js","created":"20140617211749290","modified":"20140912141809800","tags":"[[TiddlyWiki on Node.js]]","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","text":"[[TiddlyWiki on Node.js]] supports the following OS environment variables for specifying a delimited list of paths to search for plugins and editions:\n\n* `TIDDLYWIKI_PLUGIN_PATH` - Search path for ordinary plugins\n* `TIDDLYWIKI_THEME_PATH` - Search path for themes\n* `TIDDLYWIKI_LANGUAGE_PATH` - Search path for languages\n* `TIDDLYWIKI_EDITION_PATH` - Search path for editions (used by the InitCommand)\n\n''Note'': The delimiter may vary between operating systems.

Introduction\n\nA `tiddlywiki.files` JSON file in a sub-folder within [[a TiddlyWiki folder|TiddlyWikiFolders]] overrides the usual logic for recursively scanning the folder for tiddler files. Instead, the `tiddlywiki.files` file specifies instructions for loading tiddlers from specific files and folders.\n\nThe format of the file is an object with two optional properties:\n\n* ''tiddlers'' - an array of objects describing external files with the ability to override or modify any of the fields read from the file\n* ''directories'' - an array of objects describing external directories, a filter determining which files within those directories should be processed, and the ability to override or modify any of the fields read from the file\n\nNote that significant enhancements to `tiddlywiki.files` processing were introduced in [[Release 5.1.14]].\n\n!! Field overrides\n\nBoth the ''tiddlers'' and ''directories'' sections of `tiddlywiki.files` files include the ability to override or customise the values of fields with a `fields` object.\n\nEach field can be specified as either a ''string'' or ''array'' value to be assigned directly to the field, or <<.from-version \"5.1.14\">> an ''object'' describing how to generate the value for the field. The object contains the following properties:\n\n* ''source'' - (optional) a string specifying the source value for the field. If not specified, the existing value is used\n** //filename// the filename of the file containing the tiddler\n** //filename-uri-decoded// the filename of the file containing the tiddler, with [[URI decoding|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/decodeURIComponent]] applied\n** //basename// the filename of the file containing the tiddler without any extension\n** //basename-uri-decoded// the filename of the file containing the tiddler without any extension, with [[URI decoding|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/decodeURIComponent]] applied\n** //extname// the extension of the filename of the file containing the tiddler\n** //created// the creation date/time of the file containing the tiddler\n** //modified// the modification date/time of the file containing the tiddler\n* ''prefix'' - (optional) a string to be prepended to the value of the field\n* ''suffix'' - (optional) a string to be appended to the value of the field\n\n! Tiddlers section\n\nThe file specifications in the `tiddlers` array support the following properties:\n\n* ''file'': (required) the absolute or relative path to the file containing the tiddler data (relative paths are interpreted relative to the path of the `tiddlywiki.files` file)\n* ''isTiddlerFile'': (optional) if `true`, the file will be treated as a [[tiddler file|TiddlerFiles]] and deserialised to extract the tiddlers. Otherwise, the raw content of the file is assigned to the `text` field without any parsing\n* ''fields'': (optional) an object containing values that override or customise the fields provided in the tiddler file (see above)\n* ''prefix'' & ''suffix'': (optional) strings to be prefixed and suffixed to the tiddler `text` field\n*> Note that providing a ''prefix'' here is equivalent to setting the `text` field of the ''fields'' object to `{\"prefix\":\"<prefixvalue>\"}`.\n\n! Directories section\n\nDirectory specifications in the `directories` array may take the following forms:\n\n* a ''string'' literal, specifying the absolute or relative path to the directory containing the tiddler files (relative paths are interpreted relative to the path of the `tiddlywiki.files` file). The directory is recursively searched for tiddler files\n* <<.from-version \"5.1.14\">> an ''object'' with the following properties:\n** ''path'' - (required) the absolute or relative path to the directory containing the tiddler files (relative paths are interpreted relative to the path of the `tiddlywiki.files` file). Note that the directory is not recursively searched; sub-directories are ignored\n** ''filesRegExp'' - (optional) a [[regular expression|https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions]] that matches the filenames of the files that should be processed within the directory\n** ''isTiddlerFile'' - (required) if `true`, the file will be treated as a [[tiddler file|TiddlerFiles]] and deserialised to extract the tiddlers. Otherwise, the raw content of the file is assigned to the `text` field without any parsing\n** ''fields'' - (required) an object containing values that override or customise the fields provided in the tiddler file (see above)\n\nFields can be overridden for particular files by creating a file with the same name plus the suffix `.meta` -- see TiddlerFiles.\n\n! Examples\n\nThese example `tiddlywiki.files` must be placed in their own sub-directory of the [[wiki folder|TiddlyWikiFolders]].\n\nThere are also several examples of `tiddlywiki.files` files in the main [[TiddlyWiki 5 GitHub repository|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5]]. \n\n!!

Summary\n\nOn 14th November 2017 Mozilla [[released Firefox 57|https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/09/26/firefox-quantum-beta-developer-edition/]], a major new version with many improvements and security enhancements. However, in amongst those improvements are ''some fundamental changes to Firefox's security model with the unfortunate effect of making it impossible for ~TiddlyFox to function''.\n\nTiddlyFox will remain available for people who [[continue to use older versions of Firefox|https://groups.google.com/d/topic/tiddlywiki/OJQ0yRq4zog/discussion]], but anyone upgrading to the new version will need to choose a new way to handle saving changes with TiddlyWiki.\n\nHappily, several new ways of working with TiddlyWiki now exist so that users have many alternative choices -- see GettingStarted for details. The demise of TiddlyFox has provoked several of these recent developments and thus may well ultimately be good for the community.\n\nThere is a [[discussion thread|https://groups.google.com/d/topic/tiddlywiki/LcldXzPlTK0/discussion]] on the TiddlyWiki forums about these developments.\n\n! Background\n\nFirefox was first released in November 2004, a few months after the first version of TiddlyWiki. It was in many ways the Millenium Falcon to Microsoft's Death Star (in the shape of Internet Explorer). IE had by then enjoyed more than 5 years as the dominant browser, leading many in the web community to be frustrated that Microsoft's self-serving extensions to HTML had become de facto standards at the expense of innovation that might benefit the web community as a whole.\n\nFirefox quickly became successful because it managed to render web pages with close enough compatibly with Internet Explorer while offering a superior user experience. A large part of the promise of that user experience was the ability for any user to customise every aspect of the browser. Two innovations were behind this:\n\n* The entire user interface of the browser was constructed in [[XUL|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUL]], effectively an extension of HTML that enabled it to render conventional user interfaces (at the time, HTML was largely restricted to simple document-oriented layouts). Tweaking a few lines of XUL code could make wholesale changes to the user interface of the browser\n* The Mozilla add-on architecture gave full privileges to add-ons, enabling them to observe and interact deeply with the browser engine itself, and the file system of the computer on which it was running\n\nThese two conditions enabled a vibrant ecosystem of Firefox add-ons, many of them extremely popular. In many cases, innovations that were first seen in browser add-ons later became integrated into the browser itself, most notably the web debugger [[Firebug|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firebug_(software)]] which was eventually cloned by all the browser manufacturers.\n\nFirefox continued to be extremely popular until Google joined the development of the rival ~WebKit browser to make Chrome. Google took a very different approach to the trade offs of making a browser, focusing on improving security at the expense of almost all other considerations. They pioneered approaches such as isolating each tab in its own process that were quickly adopted by all other major browsers.\n\nGoogle's approach precluded them adopting Mozilla's free-for-all approach to add-ons. Instead of having access to the entire browser environment and filing system, add-ons in Chrome see only a restricted subset of what is going on within the browser, and enjoy little or no access to the resources of the host machine.\n\nIt was inevitable that Mozilla would eventually adopt Google's approach to [[browser security vis-a-vis add-ons|https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-add-technology-modernizing]]. There is a point at which it wouldn't be responsible for Mozilla to be releasing a browser that had knowingly worse security than the market leader.\n\n! Lessons\n\nSome of the fecundity of the TiddlyWiki ecosystem stems from the adoption of the above two principles from Firefox:\n\n* Making the application user interface out of the same primitives as the application content\n* Giving add-ons free rein to observe and interact with all of the internal logic of the application\n\nThose two characteristics present similar security challenges to TiddlyWiki as they did to Firefox. A TiddlyWiki that was primarily focused on security would need to curtail those abilities.\n\n! The Future\n\nInnovation on new browser-based user interfaces and capabilities has now shifted from browser extensions to a new generation of frameworks that simplify creation of a custom browser based on an off-the-shelf open source HTML rendering engine. TiddlyDesktop uses [[nwjs|https://nwjs.io]], while [[Beaker Browser]] uses an alternative called [[Electron|https://electron.atom.io/]].\n"},"TiddlyWiki in the Sky for TiddlyWeb":{"title":"TiddlyWiki in the Sky for TiddlyWeb","created":"20131129100250644","modified":"20150412185535373","tags":"[[Hosting your TiddlyWiki on the web]] Platforms","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","text":"TiddlyWiki in the Sky for TiddlyWeb allows content to be synchronised between TiddlyWiki running in the browser and a TiddlyWeb (or TiddlySpace) server.

Introduction\n\nThis release resolves a number of inconsistencies with the way that filters are handled. The changes mean that existing filters may need to be updated - particularly those that must deal with missing or shadow tiddlers.\n\n! Changes to ''is'' and addition of ''all''\n\nMost filter operators act by choosing some or all of their source titles to pass through or re-order. Those that add new entries that are not drawn from the source list are referred to as selectors. Prior to 5.0.9-beta, a few filter operators were inconsistent in whether they filtered from the source list or selected new entries into it. \n\nThe specific changes are:\n\n* The ''is'' operator now always strictly filters from the currently selected list of tiddlers\n* The new ''all'' operator acts as a selector by replacing the current list with a combination of tiddlers from specific sources:\n** ''current'' for the current tiddler\n** ''missing'' for all missing tiddlers\n** ''orphans'' for all orphan tiddlers\n** ''shadows'' for all shadow tiddlers\n** ''tiddlers'' for all non-shadow tiddlers (including both system and non-system tiddlers)\n\nThe sources for the ''all'' operator can be combined with the `+` character. For example, `[all[shadows+tiddlers]]` returns all shadow tiddlers and all ordinary tiddlers.\n\nPreviously, it was common to have `[is[shadow]]` at the start of a filter string to select all the shadow tiddlers. In 5.0.9 and above, this will not return all the shadow tiddlers, but instead just those ordinary tiddlers that are also shadow tiddlers (by virtue of having overridden one). The resolution is to use the new ''all'' operator. For example, consider this filter from 5.0.8:\n\n```\n[is[shadow]!has[draft.of]tag[$:/tags/AdvancedSearch]] [!is[shadow]!has[draft.of]tag[$:/tags/AdvancedSearch]] +[tag[$:/tags/AdvancedSearch]]\n```\n\nIn 5.0.9, that filter has been changed to:\n\n```\n[all[shadows+tiddlers]tag[$:/tags/AdvancedSearch]!has[draft.of]]\n```\n\nNote how the ''all'' operator allows operations to be performed on tiddlers from combinations of sources.\n\n!! Changes to `[is[current]]`\n\nOne result of the changes is that `[is[current]]` now strictly filters from the source tiddlers; so, if the current tiddler is a missing tiddler not in the source list, then `[is[current]]` will return an empty list.\n\nThe solution is generally to use `[all[current]]` instead. It doesn't read as well, but has the required behaviour of returning just the current tiddler, regardless of whether it is in the source tiddlers.\n\n! Changes to ''title'' and ''field''\n\nThere are minor changes to the way that the ''title'' and ''field'' operators work.\n\nThe ''title'' operator is a selector: it returns the specified title regardless of whether it is in the current source. ''title'' is used as the default operator if none is specified\n\nThe ''field'' operator is a filter: it only returns a subset of the source tiddlers. ''field'' is used as the default operator if the supplied operator is not defined (the supplied operator is passed as the suffix to the field operator, so `[description[Missing]]` is equivalent to `[field:description[Missing]]`).\n"},"Notes for upgrading to 5.0.11-beta":{"title":"Notes for upgrading to 5.0.11-beta","created":"20140516150234142","modified":"20140516150234142","tags":"[[Release 5.0.11-beta]]","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","text":"Version 5.0.11-beta includes some changes that can break content from earlier releases of ~TiddlyWiki 5.\n\n! Command line changes\n\nPreviously, commands that generate output files would interpret the specified path to the file as being relative to the current working directory. So, for example, the following command would write `index.html` to the current directory:\n\n```\ntiddlywiki mywiki --rendertiddler $:/core/save/all index.html text/plain\n```\n\nIn 5.0.11-beta this behaviour has changed, and now the specified filename is resolved relative to an `output` folder within the TiddlyWikiFolder. So the command above will now write the file `index.html` to `mywiki/output/index.html`.\n\nYou can override this behaviour with the OutputCommand. For example, to generate the `index.html` file within the current directory:\n\n```\ntiddlywiki mywiki --output . --rendertiddler $:/core/save/all index.html text/plain\n```\n\nA further change is that the `--rendertiddlers` command now clears the output folder before it writes any files. This means that any previous `--rendertiddler` commands to the same folder will have their output deleted.\n"},"Notes for upgrading to 5.0.8-beta":{"title":"Notes for upgrading to 5.0.8-beta","created":"20140223183404938","modified":"20140223195514667","tags":"[[Release 5.0.8-beta]]","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","text":"Version 5.0.8-beta includes some changes that can break content from earlier releases of ~TiddlyWiki 5.\n\n! Change to [[$:/SiteTitle]] and [[$:/SiteSubtitle]]\n\nYou should rename any existing SiteTitle and SiteSubtitle tiddlers to [[$:/SiteTitle]] and [[$:/SiteSubtitle]] respectively.\n\n! Changed parsing rules for content of HTML elements\n\nVersion 5.0.8-beta marks a change in the way that TiddlyWiki determines whether to parse the content of an HTML element or widget in //block mode// or //inline mode//.\n\n* In block mode, TiddlyWiki parses text into paragraphs, creating `<p>` tags to wrap them. It also recognises block syntax like headings, lists and tables.\n\n* In inline mode, TiddlyWiki ignores paragraph formatting, and just recognises character formatting, like bold and italic.\n\nIt's important to be able to control which type of parsing is performed for different situations.\n\nPrior to 5.0.8-beta, TiddlyWiki parsed the content of an element in inline mode unless the opening tag of the element were immediately followed by a line break. This meant that much of the time element tags would be shunted together into a long line, hindering readability.\n\nThe new behaviour for 5.0.8-beta is to parse the content of an element in inline mode unless the opening tag is immediately followed by two line breaks.\n\nTo adjust existing content for 5.0.8-beta you will need to manually add the additional line break after the opening tag of elements and widgets whose content should be parsed in block mode.\n\nThe positive aspect of the change is that it removes the need to pack multiple HTML tags onto a single line, improving readability.\n\n!! Examples\n\nConsider the difference between these two examples. First, here's an HTML tag that starts with two line breaks:\n\n<<wikitext-example src:\"\n<blockquote>\n\n! This is a heading\n\nAnd a paragraph of text.\n\n</blockquote>\n\">>\n\nSecondly, here's an HTML tag with just a single line break. Notice how the heading is no longer recognised as a heading\n\n<<wikitext-example src:\"\n<blockquote>\n! This is a heading\n\nAnd a paragraph of text.\n</blockquote>\n\">>\n\n! Changed commands for [[TiddlyWiki on Node.js]]\n\nThe handling of wiki folders has changed. Previously, if the `tiddlywiki` command was run against a wiki folder that didn't have the necessary `tiddlywiki.info` file then it would be automatically created. Now, the wiki folder must be initialised with the InitCommand.\n\nThis is how to create and start a new server-based wiki:\n\n```\ntiddlywiki mywikifolder --init server\ntiddlywiki mywikifolder --server\n```\n\nNote that the name of the ''clientserver'' edition has changed to ''server''.\n\n"},"Release 5.0.10-beta":{"title":"Release 5.0.10-beta","created":"20140416160234142","modified":"20150118182457000","tags":"BetaReleaseNotes","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","released":"201404191305","caption":"5.0.10-beta","text":"//[[See GitHub for detailed change history of this release|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/compare/v5.0.9-beta...v5.0.10-beta]]//\n\n!!

Major Changes\n\n!!! Improved Control Panel Plugins Tab\n\nThe ''Plugins'' tab of the [[control panel|$:/ControlPanel]] has been improved with the addition of documentation tabs that plugins can use to show documentation. There is also a larger draggable area for dragging tiddlers across to other wikis.\n\n!!! Configurable Button Toolbars\n\nThe page toolbar and the tiddler toolbars can now be configured with several new buttons - see the [[control panel|$:/ControlPanel]] under the ''Appearance'' and ''Toolbars'' tabs.\n\nThe sidebar tools tab now shows all the available page controls, allowing them to be invoked or checked to appear in the toolbar. The tiddler info area now includes a tools tab that includes buttons for all the tiddler actions.\n\n!!! Upgrade Mechanism\n\nThere are two components:\n\n* A more flexible ImportMechanism that:\n** Presents incoming tiddlers as a pending import list that allows the user to inspect them and, if necessary, explicitly deselect them from the actual import\n** Provides UpgraderModules with an opportunity to process each incoming tiddler\n*** The [[plugin upgrader|$:/core/modules/upgraders/plugins.js]] module handles version checking of plugins and upgrading them from a special UpgradeLibrary plugin tiddler\n*** The [[system upgrader|$:/core/modules/upgraders/system.js]] module is responsible for suppressing the importing of certain system tiddlers (currently [[$:/StoryList]] and [[$:/HistoryList]])\n*** The [[themetweak upgrader|$:/core/modules/upgraders/themetweaks.js]] module handles migrating theme tweaks from their pre-5.0.14-beta format (see below)\n* An UpgradePlugin and associated edition that provides a custom, single-purpose user interface for upgrading standalone TiddlyWiki files - see https://tiddlywiki.com/upgrade.html\n\n!!! Improvements to CamelCase Recognition\n\nTiddlyWiki now takes a much more conservative approach to recognising CamelCase terms that should be automatically linked. Previously, the dash and underscore were treated as lower case letters, leading to a number of false positives. See the [[GitHub bug #337|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/issues/337]] for details.\n\n!!! Automatic Permalinking Off by Default\n\nWith previous beta releases of TiddlyWiki the browser address bar is automatically updated so that it dynamically reflects the tiddlers that are currently open. This makes it easier to get a permalink for copying and pasting elsewhere, but it leads to much confusion for casual users who don't always understand why unexpected tiddlers are being displayed after they have refreshed the page in the browser.\n\nFor 5.0.14-beta, the setting has been changed.

Incompatible Changes\n\n!!! Change System Tag `$:/tags/stylesheet` with `$:/tags/Stylesheet`\n\nThe [[issue|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/issues/824]] is that the capitalisation of `$:/tags/stylesheet` is not consistent with other system tags.

Support for `$:/tags/stylesheet` will be removed before the beta.\n\n* [[Added|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/commit/f6ff0a7f715bdf12dfba6556f72c49ea2c3016b0]] support for `$:/tags/Stylesheet` and a deprecation warning when `$:/tags/stylesheet` is used\n\n!!! Change ButtonWidget `title` attribute to `tooltip`\n\nThe use of the `title` attribute in the ButtonWidget was not consistent with the `tooltip` attribute used by the ImageWidget and LinkWidget.

Removing Support for RegExp Filter Operands\n\nAs discussed in [[the associated ticket|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/issues/762]], the support for regular expression filter operands is incomplete and inconsistent. The plan is to remove support for this feature in the next release. A new filter operator has been provided to replace it, along with the addition of a deprecation warning that is displayed whenever regular expression filter operators are used.\n\n* [[Added|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/commit/f4fff7a33037ba9dd537379bcb44a52a280868d6]] new <<.olink regexp>> operator\n* [[Added|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/commit/d45c417c187fe3dcc35ee7a308e64feebc7b185b]] deprecation warning for regular expression filter operators\n\n!!!

Major Improvements\n\n!! Performance Optimisations\n\nThis release includes several low-level performance optimisations that should improve speed and responsiveness in many common operations.\n\n* [[Caching the results of parsing a tiddler|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/commit/b0cb17cd83dde89753ec159e27c920a7bf22bee1]]\n* [[Loop optimisations|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/commit/c6e48ebc2db4af895f5b3935b3f575b8aab292fe]]\n* [[Tiddler iteration optimisations|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/commit/8f63e2a959a7ac44533ae2b6192716ee17a1ce93]]\n* [[State qualifier generation|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/commit/848a7f4e744c8f4dcb4ec88a0e99c4ae6aac25e5]]\n* [[Caching data tiddlers|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/commit/32f6d7f1b01474b82debcbdd5d76c49c59303265]]\n* [[Removed expensive visual effects|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/commit/4f5cf4597abb08af787b62c2e2ee1b8c667dad1e]]\n\nThere is a new setting in the control panel to enable performance instrumentation, making it much easier to measure and improve performance issues.\n\n!! New Editions\n\nThree new editions of TiddlyWiki are included in this release. These can be used as starting points for creating your own wiki for several purposes:\n\n* The [[Résumé Builder Edition]] by @inmysocks is a custom edition to guide you through the process of using TiddlyWiki to create a good looking résumé (or curriculum vitæ)\n* The [[Blog Edition]] provides tools for using TiddlyWiki under Node.js to create a static HTML blog that can be published on GitHub pages (or similar)\n* The [[Text-Slicer Edition]] is a custom edition with tools to help advanced users slice longer texts up into individual tiddlers.\n\n!! External Text Tiddlers\n\nLimited support for tiddlers stored in external `.tid` files:\n\n* standalone TiddlyWiki HTML files with external text tiddlers can be built under Node.js\n* wikis with external text tiddlers can be worked with in the browser, automatically lazily loading the content of external text tiddlers when it is first referenced\n** saving changes in the browser doesn't work as expected: if edited, the external text tiddler is replaced with an ordinary tiddler\n** lazy loading of external text tiddlers doesn't work in Chrome when viewing the TiddlyWiki HTML file on a ''file:'' URI; it works OK in Firefox\n** lazy loading works on an HTTP URI on all browsers as long as the target file is either stored on the same domain or is served by a [[server that supports CORS|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing]]\n\nSee [[Alice in Wonderland]] for an example. Try opening it without a network connection.\n\n!! New \"Tight\" Theme\n\nA new theme called \"Tight\" uses reduced padding, margins and font-sizes to pack as much text as possible:\n\n<$button>\n<$action-setfield $tiddler=\"$:/theme\" text=\"$:/themes/tiddlywiki/tight\"/>\nTry it out\n</$button> <$button>\n<$action-setfield $tiddler=\"$:/theme\" text=\"$:/themes/tiddlywiki/snowwhite\"/>\nRevert\n</$button>\n\n!

Install TiddlyWiki and setup a new wiki\n\n# Create a convenient directory for the wiki (e.g. `C:\\MyStuff`)\n# Within it, create a file called `C:\\MyStuff\\package.json` with the content:\n#> <<example-file \"Example package.json for IIS\">>\n# Also create a file called `C:\\MyStuff\\web.config` with the content:\n#> <<example-file \"Example web.config for IIS\">>\n# Create a subdirectory called \"wiki\" (i.e. `C:\\MyStuff\\wiki`)\n# Create a file called `C:\\MyStuff\\wiki\\tiddlywiki.info` with the content:\n#> <<example-file \"Example tiddlywiki.info for IIS\">>\n# Create a subdirectory called \"tiddlers\" (i.e. `C:\\MyStuff\\wiki\\tiddlers`)\n# Within it, create a file called `C:\\MyStuff\\wiki\\tiddlers\\config-tiddlyweb-host.tid` with the content:\n#> <<example-file \"Example config-tiddlyweb-host for IIS\">>\n#* (See [[the documentation|https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/extensions/httpplatformhandler/httpplatformhandler-configuration-reference]] for details of the configuration fields for ~HttpPlatformHandler\n\n! 4. Setup the application in IIS\n\n* In Windows, run the IIS Manager application (use the start menu to run `inetmgr.exe`)\n* Locate the server in the ''Connections'' column on the left, and click the disclosure triangle to show its content\n* Open the ''Sites'' folder\n* Right click on the ''Default Web Site'' entry, and select ''Add application..'' from the menu\n* Enter the following information in the dialogue box:\n*# ''Alias'': `MyApp`\n*# ''Physical path'': `C:\\MyStuff`\n* Click ''OK''\n\n! 5. Test the application\n\nTest the app by visiting http://localhost/MyApp/ in a browser.\n\n! Notes\n\n* If you require authentication, specify a username and password in the `--server` command in `web.config`. For example:\n** `arguments=\".\\node_modules\\tiddlywiki\\tiddlywiki.js ./wiki-server --server PORT $:/core/save/all text/plain text/html &quot;username&quot; &quot;password&quot; 127.0.0.1 /MyApp\">`\n** Take note of the need to HTML encode the double quotes around the username and password into `&quot;`\n* If you change the settings in the `web.config` file, or modify the app code, then you'll need to restart the server using the IIS manager application\n\n"},"Saving on a PHP Server":{"title":"Saving on a PHP Server","caption":"PHP","created":"20140111091844267","delivery":"DIY","description":"DIY script you can install on your own server","method":"save","modified":"20171115171431733","tags":"Saving PHP","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","text":"The built-in `TiddlySpot `saver can also be used to save changes to a simple PHP script that you can run on most hosting providers.\n\n//These are preliminary instructions that need verification//\n\n# Download a copy of `TiddlyHome_0.1.2.zip` from https://code.google.com/archive/p/bidix/downloads\n# Unzip. \n# Extract a copy of `store.php` from under the unzipped subdirectory `_th\\lib`\n# Edit your copy of ''store.php'' to add your username(s) and password(s).

It has two main areas, each with its own tone and audience:\n\n* [[Instruction Tiddlers]]\n* [[Reference Tiddlers]]\n\nWe keep the two areas distinct. This avoids overwhelming relative newcomers, while still providing quick access to the information that expert users need.\n\nAdditional topics:\n\n* [[Tiddler Title Policy]]\n* [[Tiddler Structure]]\n* [[Spelling]]\n* [[Typography]]\n* [[Documentation Macros]]\n* [[Technical Prose Style]]\n"},"Instruction Tiddlers":{"title":"Instruction Tiddlers","created":"20150110101500000","modified":"20150117152550000","tags":"[[Improving TiddlyWiki Documentation]]","text":"<<.def \"Instruction tiddlers\">> talk directly to the reader and guide them through a process. The reader is likely to be a beginner or an intermediate user.\n\nSuch tiddlers can be subcategorised as:\n\n;Welcome\n* What is ~TiddlyWiki and why should I care?\n* Demonstrations of key features and benefits\n* Frequently asked questions\n* Examples of ~TiddlyWiki in the field\n* Information about the project itself\n\n;Tutorial\n* An ordered presentation of material for beginners\n* Each tiddler introduces one new point or concept\n* Its main content contains very few links\n* A revealable <<.word \"Find out more\">> section at the end can offer related links\n\n;Exercise\n* Accompanying a tutorial tiddler\n* Solution revealed on demand\n\n;How-to\n* A list of numbered steps for performing a small specific task\n* Concise, with links to reference tiddlers where appropriate\n* Often has a preamble to clarify the nature of the task\n\n;Example\n* Accompanying a [[reference tiddler|Reference Tiddlers]]\n* Can contain explanations and similar commentary\n* Kept separate to keep the reference tiddler pure\n\nInstruction tiddlers talk directly to the reader as <<.word you>>. They can be reasonably chatty.\n\nBut they avoid excessively colloquial language, cultural or topical references and attempts at humour, as these can baffle or even offend the international readership. They also avoid potentially frustrating the reader with descriptions of features as <<.word convenient>> or <<.word easy>>.\n"},"Reference Tiddlers":{"title":"Reference Tiddlers","created":"20141226192500000","modified":"20150117152552000","tags":"[[Improving TiddlyWiki Documentation]]","text":"<<.def \"Reference tiddlers\">> offer raw information in a comprehensive interlinked way. The reader is likely to be an intermediate or expert user.\n\nThere are several subcategories:\n\n;Concepts\n* With definitions, together forming a glossary\n\n;User manual\n* Presenting technical details of ~WikiText features\n* Subcategorised: messages, operators, widgets, etc\n\n;Developer manual\n* Presenting technical details of ~TiddlyWiki's internal architecture\n\nReference material is written in a terse, formal style that avoids referring to the reader, and instead focuses on how ~TiddlyWiki itself behaves. The passive voice is often suitable:\n\n* <<.word \"the template is specified as a tiddler\">> rather than <<.word \"specify the template as a tiddler\">>\n* <<.word \"the widget can be used for various purposes\">> rather than <<.word \"you can use the widget for various purposes\">>\n* But <<.word \"this widget has several possible uses\">> is better, because it is less convoluted and more succinct\n\nMost contracted verb forms are avoided in reference tiddlers. But those ending in <<.word \"n't\">> (<<.word \"aren't\">>, <<.word \"doesn't\">>, <<.word \"hasn't\">>, <<.word \"isn't\">>, etc) are acceptable, as they make it less easy to accidentally overlook the word <<.word not>>.\n"},"Spelling":{"title":"Spelling","created":"20150110182900000","modified":"20150117152553000","tags":"[[Improving TiddlyWiki Documentation]]","text":"Because ~TiddlyWiki is of British origin, its English documentation uses [[British spelling in preference to US spelling|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences]].\n\nWords like <<.word customise>> are spelled <<.word -ise>>, not <<.word -ize>>. Words like <<.word colour>> will also be spelled using UK English unless they are being used for reserved words in code, such as in CSS or JavaScript.\n\nStandard technical acronyms are written in upper case, without dots: <<.word HTML>>, not <<.word html>> or <<.word H.T.M.L.>>\n\nAvoid arbitrarily abbreviating words and sentences. But the following abbreviations are acceptable:\n\n|!Abbreviation |!Meaning |!Notes |\n|e.g. |for example |with a dot after each letter |\n|i.e. |that is to say |with a dot after each letter |\n|etc |and so on |without a dot |\n"},"Technical Prose Style":{"title":"Technical Prose Style","created":"20150110182900000","modified":"20150117152555000","tags":"[[Improving TiddlyWiki Documentation]]","text":"When writing an [[instruction tiddler|Instruction Tiddlers]], start by planning a route through the information you wish to present. This should be a simple, logical, direct progression of thoughts, with no backtracking or forward references. Use this approach even within individual sentences: always proceed from cause to effect, from the old or known to the new or unknown.\n\nKeep sentences short and simple. A clear technical sentence seldom contains more than one idea. It therefore avoids parenthetical information. Similarly, keep paragraph structure simple. A flat presentation is often easier to understand than a hierarchical one.\n\nIt is often possible to simplify a sentence without changing its meaning, merely by adjusting its vocabulary or grammatical structure. <<.word \"Execution of the macro is performed\">> just means <<.word \"The macro runs\">>. <<.word \"Your expectation might be...\">> just means <<.word \"You might expect...\">>.\n\nPrefer the active voice by default: <<.word \"Jane creates a tiddler\">> rather than <<.word \"a tiddler is created by Jane\">>. The passive voice can be useful if you want the reader to focus on the action itself or its result: <<.word \"a tiddler is created\">>. But it can often be clearer to proceed from cause to effect and say <<.word \"this creates a tiddler\">> in the active voice.\n\nDocumentation often presents two items that are parallel either by similarity or by difference. The reader will more easily detect such a pattern if you use the same sentence or phrase structure for both. But this must be balanced with the need to avoid monotony.\n\nPrefer precise instructions over woolly descriptions. If something has a name, use it. If something lacks a name, give it a tiddler.\n"},"Tiddler Structure":{"title":"Tiddler Structure","created":"20150110183300000","modified":"20150117152556000","tags":"[[Improving TiddlyWiki Documentation]]","text":"In accordance with the [[Philosophy of Tiddlers]], documentation tiddlers are typically short and interlinked.\n\nWhen a tiddler seems as if it needs to contain subheadings, this is often a sign that it should in fact be split into several tiddlers. But it is reasonable for a [[reference tiddler|Reference Tiddlers]] to consist of an untitled introductory section followed by a titled section of details.\n\nConsistency of terminology is essential if the reader is not to become confused. Consistent typography and punctuation lend a professional quality to the documentation. Macros can improve the consistency and maintainability of the text.\n\nUse numbered lists for step-by-step instructions, and bullet points for lists whose order is arbitrary. Use a definition list in preference to a bulleted list if each bulleted item would begin with a term and a colon. If at all possible, avoid burdening the reader with a nested list.\n\nUse a table when information naturally falls into three or more columns, and also for lists of parameters, attributes, etc in [[reference tiddlers|Reference Tiddlers]].\n\nThe documentation describes the current reality of ~TiddlyWiki. Avoid discussing future aspirations.\n"},"Tiddler Title Policy":{"title":"Tiddler Title Policy","created":"20150110183300000","modified":"20150118183633000","tags":"[[Improving TiddlyWiki Documentation]]","text":"Many documentation tiddlers, especially the [[reference ones|Reference Tiddlers]], are concerned with a single concept. Their titles should be succinct noun phrases like <<.tid \"List Widget\">> or <<.tid \"Tiddler Fields\">>.\n\nEach of the main words of such a title begins with a capital letter. Minor words such as <<.word and>>, <<.word or>>, <<.word the>>, <<.word to>> and <<.word with>> do not.\n\nTags also follow this pattern.\n\nTitles of this kind are plural if they denote a category of items, e.g. <<.tid \"Keyboard Shortcuts\">> or <<.tid \"Tiddler Fields\">>. Such titles are used to tag more specific tiddlers within the category.\n\nWhere a concept is an item rather than a category, its tiddler has a singular title, e.g. <<.tid \"List Widget\">>, <<.tid \"tag Operator\">>.\n\nStart a title with its most distinctive part. For instance, the tiddlers documenting the filter operators have titles like <<.tid \"addprefix Operator\">>. This helps the reader scan a list of links to find a particular tiddler.\n\nAvoid starting a title with the word <<.word the>>.\n\nIn the past, many tiddlers had CamelCase titles. This is gradually being phased out of the documentation to improve readability. ~CamelCase titles should no longer be used, even for tags, except in cases like <<.tid ~JavaScript>> where that is the standard spelling.\n\n[[Instruction tiddlers|Instruction Tiddlers]] often have longer titles that can be more complicated than just a noun phrase, e.g. <<.tid \"Ten reasons to switch to ~TiddlyWiki\">>. These titles use sentence case, i.e. only the first word (and any proper names) starts with a capital letter.\n\nHow-to tiddlers have titles that begin with <<.word \"How to\">>, e.g. <<.tid \"How to edit a tiddler\">>. Avoid titles like <<.tid \"Editing tiddlers\">>, because a less fluent English speaker could misunderstand that as the name of a category of tiddlers.\n"},"Typography":{"title":"Typography","created":"20141226192500000","modified":"20150117152559000","text":"Use the [[documentation macros|Documentation Macros]] to keep the text maintainable in the face of change.\n\nBe wary of arbitrarily applying raw bold or italic markup in a sentence. If there's a suitable macro, use that instead. If there isn't a suitable macro, write one or request one.\n\nUse simple backticks (<code>&#96;...&#96;</code>) for fragments of WikiText, but not for the names of things like fields and widgets. These have their own macros.\n\nTo keep things clean and simple, quotation marks and apostrophes should be straight `'`, not curly `’`, and the ellipsis should be three separate dots `...` rather than `…`.\n\nUse `\"` as the primary quotation mark, reserving `'` for the rare case of a nested quotation.\n\nAvoid using a single hyphen `-` as sentence punctuation. Instead, use a double hyphen -- which ~TiddlyWiki renders as an en-dash -- with a space on either side.\n\nItems in lists and tables should only end with a full stop (period in US English) if they are complete sentences. They should have no trailing punctuation otherwise.\n\nIt is very rarely necessary to use an exclamation mark in professional documentation.\n"},"$:/ContributionBanner":{"title":"$:/ContributionBanner","tags":"$:/tags/EditTemplate","list-after":"$:/core/ui/EditTemplate/title","text":"\\define makeGitHubLink()\nhttps://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/edit/master/editions/tw5.com/tiddlers/$(githubLink)$\n\\end\n\\define innerMakeGitHubLink(linkText)\n<$set name=\"githubLink\" value={{$:/config/OriginalTiddlerPaths##$(draftOfTiddler)$}}>\n<a href=<<makeGitHubLink>> class=\"tc-tiddlylink-external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$linkText$</a>\n</$set>\n\\end\n\\define outerMakeGitHubLink(linkText)\n<$set name=\"draftOfTiddler\" value={{$(currentTiddler)$!!draft.of}}>\n<<innerMakeGitHubLink \"$linkText$\">>\n</$set>\n\\end\n<div class=\"tc-improvement-banner\">\n{{$:/core/images/star-filled}} Can you help us improve this documentation?

Action widgets are used in association with other widgets that trigger those actions (for example, the ButtonWidget).\n\nThe following action widgets are provided:\n\n<<list-links \"[tag[ActionWidgets]]\">>\n\nThere are two ways to use action widgets:\n\n* Using the `actions` attribute of the triggering widget (this is the preferred way)\n* Embedding the actions within the triggering widget (an older technique that is now deprecated)\n\n!! Assigning action widgets with the `actions` attribute\n\nThe action widgets are passed as a string to the `actions` attribute of the triggering widget. Usually, it is more convenient to use a macro to assign the action widgets to a variable. For example, here is a button that triggers two actions of sending different messages:\n\n```\n\\define my-actions()\n<$action-sendmessage $message=\"tm-home\"/>\n<$action-sendmessage $message=\"tm-full-screen\"/>\n\\end\n\n<$button actions=<<my-actions>>>\nClick me!\n</$button>\n```\n\n!! Assigning action widgets by embedding\n\nThe action widgets need not be immediate children of their triggering widget, but they must be descendents of it. The actions are performed in sequence. Here is the above example rewritten to use embedding:\n\n```\n<$button>\n<$action-sendmessage $message=\"tm-home\"/>\n<$action-sendmessage $message=\"tm-full-screen\"/>\nClick me!\n</$button>\n```\n\n"},"BrowseWidget":{"title":"BrowseWidget","caption":"browse","created":"20131024141900000","modified":"20170718142410367","tags":"Widgets","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","text":"!

Introduction\n\nThe checkbox widget displays an HTML `<input type=\"checkbox\">` element that is dynamically bound to either:\n\n* the presence or absence of a specified tag on a specified tiddler\n* the value of a specified field of a specified tiddler\n\n! Content and Attributes\n\nThe content of the `<$checkbox>` widget is displayed within an HTML `<label>` element immediately after the checkbox itself. This means that clicking on the content will toggle the checkbox.\n\n|!Attribute |!Description |\n|tiddler |Title of the tiddler to manipulate (defaults to the [[current tiddler|Current Tiddler]]) |\n|tag |The name of the tag to which the checkbox is bound |\n|invertTag |When set to ''yes'', flips the tag binding logic so that the absence of the tag causes the checkbox to be checked  |\n|field |The name of the field to which the checkbox is bound |\n|index|<<.from-version \"5.1.14\">> The index of the //tiddler//, a [[DataTiddler|DataTiddlers]], to which the checkbox is bound<<.tip \"be sure to set the //tiddler// correctly\">>|\n|checked |The value of the field corresponding to the checkbox being checked |\n|unchecked |The value of the field corresponding to the checkbox being unchecked |\n|default |The default value to use if the field is not defined |\n|class |The class that will be assigned to the label element |\n|actions |<<.from-version \"5.1.14\">> A string containing ActionWidgets to be triggered when the checkbox is checked |\n|uncheckactions |<<.from-version \"5.1.16\">> A string containing ActionWidgets to be triggered when the checkbox is unchecked |\n\n!! Tag Mode\n\nUsing the checkbox widget in tag mode requires the ''tag'' attribute to specify the name of the tag. The ''tiddler'' attribute specifies the tiddler to target, defaulting to the current tiddler if not present.\n\nThis example creates a checkbox that flips the ''done'' tag on the current tiddler:\n\n<<wikitext-example-without-html \"\"\"<$checkbox tag=\"done\"> Is it done?</$checkbox>\"\"\">>\n\n!! Field Mode\n\nUsing the checkbox widget in field mode requires the ''field'' attribute to specify the name of the field. The ''checked'' and ''unchecked'' attributes specify the values to be assigned to the field to correspond to its checked and unchecked states respectively. The ''default'' attribute is used as a fallback value if the field is not defined.\n\nThis example creates a checkbox that is checked if the field ''status'' is equal to ''open'' and unchecked if the field is equal to ''closed''. If the field is undefined then it defaults to ''closed'', meaning that the checkbox will be unchecked if the ''status'' field is missing.\n\n<<wikitext-example-without-html \"\"\"<$checkbox field=\"status\" checked=\"open\" unchecked=\"closed\" default=\"closed\"> Is it open?</$checkbox><br>''status:'' {{!!status}}\"\"\">>\n\n!! Index Mode\n\nTo use the checkbox widget in index mode set the ''index'' attribute to the index of a [[DataTiddler|DataTiddlers]]. The ''checked'' and ''unchecked'' attributes specify the values to be assigned to the index and correspond to its checked and unchecked states respectively. The ''default'' attribute is used as a fallback value if the index is undefined.\n\nThe example below creates a checkbox that is checked if the index by the name of this tiddler in the tiddler ExampleData is equal to ''selected'' and unchecked if the index is an empty string. If the index is undefined then it defaults to an empty string, meaning the checkbox will be unchecked if the index is missing.\n\n<$macrocall $name=\"wikitext-example-without-html\" src=\"\"\"<$checkbox tiddler=\"ExampleData\" index=<<currentTiddler>> checked=\"selected\" unchecked=\"\" default=\"\"> Selected?</$checkbox>\"\"\"/>\n\n!! `actions` Attribute\n\nThis example of using the `actions` attribute shows both the [[Action Set Field Widget|ActionSetFieldWidget]] and [[Action Send Message Widget|ActionSendMessageWidget]] to demonstrate two actions.\n\nThe [[Set Widget|SetWidget]] uses a filter value to set the value of variable `tag`. The [[Action Send Message Widget|ActionSendMessageWidget]] joins all  the tags into one large tag. The [[Action Set Field Widget|ActionSetFieldWidget]] appends the tags as individual tags.  In this example, the [[Field Mangler Widget|FieldManglerWidget]] is required for the [[Action Send Message Widget|ActionSendMessageWidget]] but not for [[Action Set Field Widget|ActionSetFieldWidget]]. Be aware that the action occurs whether you check or uncheck.\n\nIt is often necessary to use triple quotes with the `actions` attribute. Alternatively, the attribute can be assigned directly from a variable with `actions=<<my-actions>>`.\n\n<$macrocall $name='wikitext-example-without-html' src='<$fieldmangler>\n<$set filter=\"[[Features]] [[Encryption]] +[tags[]]\" name=\"tag\">\n<$checkbox actions=\"\"\"<$action-setfield  $field=\"tags\" $value=<<tag>> /><$action-sendmessage $message=\"tm-add-tag\" $param=<<tag>> />\"\"\" field=\"checked\" checked=\"YES\" unchecked=\"NO\" >\n    Add tags from tiddlers [[Features]] and [[Encryption]]\n</$checkbox>\n</$set>\n</$fieldmangler>' />\n\n"},"CodeBlockWidget":{"title":"CodeBlockWidget","caption":"codeblock","created":"20151103160200000","modified":"20160817175325205","tags":"Widgets","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","text":"!

Introduction\n\nThe edit text widget provides a user interface in the browser for editing text tiddler fields. The editing element is dynamically bound to the underlying tiddler value: changes to the tiddler are instantly reflected, and any edits are instantly propogated.\n\nBy default, applying the EditTextWidget to the `text` field of a tiddler will generates an HTML `<textarea>` element, i.e. a multi-line editor. Applying the EditTextWidget to any other field generates an HTML `<input type=\"text\">` element, a single-line editor. This behaviour can be overridden with the `tag` and `type` attributes.\n\n! Content and Attributes\n\nThe content of the `<$edit-text>` widget is ignored.\n\n|!Attribute |!Description |\n|tiddler |The tiddler to edit (defaults to the [[current tiddler|Current Tiddler]]) |\n|field |The field to edit (defaults to `text`).

For a multi-line editor use `tag=textarea`. For a single-line editor use `tag=input` |\n|type |Overrides the generated HTML editing element `type` attribute |\n|size |The size of the input field (in characters) |\n|autoHeight |Either \"yes\" or \"no\" to specify whether to automatically resize `textarea` editors to fit their content (defaults to \"yes\") |\n|minHeight |Minimum height for automatically resized `textarea` editors, specified in CSS length units such as \"px\", \"em\" or \"%\" |\n|rows|Sets the rows attribute of a generated textarea |\n\n! Notes\n\nOne trap to be aware of is that the edit text widget //cannot be used// to edit a field of the tiddler that contains it. Each keypress results in the tiddler being re-rendered, which loses the cursor position within the text field.\n\nInstead, place the edit text widget in a [[template|TemplateTiddlers]] that references the tiddler you want to modify.\n\nFor example, if you wanted the tiddler GettingStarted to edit the value of the \"myconfig\" field of the tiddler \"AppSettings\", you might do so by creating a separate tiddler \"ChangeAppSettings\" that contains the following:\n\n```\n<$edit-text tiddler=\"AppSettings\" field=\"myconfig\"/>\n```\n\nAnd reference the template in any other tiddler (e.g. GettingStarted) with `{{ChangeAppSettings}}`.\n\nThis works when your use of the tiddler //is not// the AppSettings itself which would cause a recursion problem. In this latter case you have to save the fields to a temporary (or alternative) tiddler (sort of the reverse of above) like so:\n\n```\n<$edit-text tiddler=\"StoreAppSettings\" field=\"myconfig\"/>\n```\n\nIn short the EditTextWidget //can not// change properties of the tiddler it is embedded in or part of. It can only change fields of //other// tiddlers. One could use ShadowTiddlers to accomplish the field storage if needed.\n"},"EditWidget":{"title":"EditWidget","created":"201310241419","modified":"20150220161220000","tags":"Widgets","caption":"edit","text":"!

The draggable functionality is equivalent to using the DraggableWidget with the ''tiddler'' attribute set to the link target.\n\nThe default value of the tooltip attribute is supplied by the <<.vlink tv-wikilink-tooltip>> variable.\n\nThis means that you can control the text of a link tooltip in several ways:\n\n```\n<$link to=\"HelloThere\" tooltip=\"Custom tooltip\">Link 1</$link>\n\n<$set name=\"tv-wikilink-tooltip\" value=\"I'm a link to {{!!title}}\">\n<$link to=\"HelloThere\">Link 2</$link>\n</$set>\n\n```\n\nRenders as:\n\n<$link to=\"HelloThere\" tooltip=\"Custom tooltip\">Link 1</$link>\n\n<$set name=\"tv-wikilink-tooltip\" value=\"I'm a link to {{!!title}}\">\n<$link to=\"HelloThere\">Link 2</$link>\n</$set>\n\nNote that the tooltip is rendered with the current tiddler set to the target of the link.\n\nA useful convention is to set the tooltip like this:\n\n```\n\\define tv-wikilink-tooltip()\n<$transclude field=\"tooltip\"><$transclude field=\"title\"/></$transclude>\n\\end\n```\n\nThis causes the tooltip to be the ''tooltip'' field of the target tiddler. If the field isn't present, then the title is used instead.\n\n! CSS Classes\n\nThe link widget automatically determines and applies the following classes to links:\n\n* `tc-tiddlylink` - applied to all links\n* `tc-tiddlylink-external` - applied to external, non-tiddler links\n* `tc-tiddlylink-internal` - applied to tiddler links\n* `tc-tiddlylink-missing` - applied to tiddler links where the target tiddler doesn't exist\n* `tc-tiddlylink-resolves` - applied to tiddler links when the target tiddler does exist\n\nUse the `class` attribute to specify additional css classes, or `overrideClass` to apply only that but not the above defaults, e.g. when used in a LinkCatcherWidget:\n\n<<wikitext-example-without-html \"\"\"*<$link class=\"example\">Here</$link> the `example` class is added.\n*<$link overrideClass=\"example\">Here</$link> only the `example` class applies.\n*<$link overrideClass=\"\">Here</$link> no class is set.\"\"\">>\n\n! `href` generation\n\nThe following process is used to generate the `href` attribute of the generated HTML `<a>` element:\n\n# If <<.vlink tv-get-export-link>> is defined it is invoked to convert the target tiddler title to the `href` value\n#* In practice, only a [[JavaScript macro|Macros]] can be used\n# <<.from-version \"5.1.15\">> If <<.vlink tv-filter-export-link>> is defined it is interpreted as a filter that converts the target tiddler title to the `href` value\n# If <<.vlink tv-wikilink-template>> is defined it is treated as a specialised macro body that can perform limited conversion of the target tiddler title to the `href` value\n# Otherwise, the target tiddler title is URI encoded to create the `href`\n\n! Configuration variables\n\n* <<.vlink tv-wikilinks>>\n* <<.vlink tv-filter-export-link>>\n* <<.vlink tv-wikilink-template>>\n* <<.vlink tv-wikilink-tooltip>>\n* <<.vlink tv-get-export-link>>\n"},"ListopsData":{"title":"ListopsData","created":"20151017094630847","daysoftheweek":"four three Fri Thu Wed Tue Mon","modified":"20151108041839747","type":"application/x-tiddler-dictionary","text":"DataIndex: \n"},"ListWidget":{"title":"ListWidget","created":"201310241419","modified":"201502231037","tags":"Widgets Lists","caption":"list","text":"! Introduction\n\nThe list widget displays a sequence of tiddlers that match a [[tiddler filter|Filters]]. It can be used for many purposes:\n\n* Displaying custom lists of links, like in TiddlyWiki5's sidebar\n* Custom lists, such as \"all tiddlers tagged 'task' that are not tagged 'done'\"\n* Listing each of the tags applied to a tiddler\n* Handling the main story river\n\nThe tiddlers are displayed by transcluding each in turn through a template. There are several ways to specify the template and for controlling the behaviour of the list.\n\n! Examples\n\n''plain list''\n\n```\n<$list filter=\"[tag[ListWidget]sort[title]]\"/>\n```\n\nDisplays as:\n\n<<<\n<$list filter=\"[tag[ListWidget]sort[title]]\"/>\n\n<<<\n\n''custom item output''\n\n```\n<$list filter=\"[tag[ListWidget]sort[title]]\">\n<<currentTiddler>>\n{{||$:/core/ui/ViewTemplate/tags}}\n</$list>\n```\n\nDisplays as:\n\n<<<\n<$list filter=\"[tag[ListWidget]sort[title]]\">\n<<currentTiddler>>\n{{||$:/core/ui/ViewTemplate/tags}}\n</$list>\n<<<\n\n''custom item template''\n\n```\n<$list filter=\"[tag[ListWidget]sort[title]]\" template=\"$:/core/ui/ViewTemplate/subtitle\"/>\n```\n\nDisplays as:\n\n<<<\n<$list filter=\"[tag[ListWidget]sort[title]]\" template=\"$:/core/ui/ViewTemplate/subtitle\"/>\n\n<<<\n\n!! Grouped Lists\n\nSee GroupedLists for how to generate nested and grouped lists using the ListWidget.\n\n! Content and Attributes\n\nThe content of the `<$list>` widget is an optional template to use for rendering each tiddler in the list. Alternatively, the template can be specified as a tiddler title in the ``template`` attribute. As a fallback, the default template just displays the tiddler title.\n\n|!Attribute |!Description |\n|filter |The [[tiddler filter|Filters]] to display |\n|template |The title of a template tiddler for transcluding each tiddler in the list.

Edit mode\n\nThe `<$list>` widget can optionally render draft tiddlers through a different template to handle editing, see DraftMechanism.\n\n!! `storyview` attribute\n\nThe `storyview` attribute specifies the name of an optional module that can animate changes to the list (including navigation). The core ships with the following storyview modules:\n\n* `classic`: renders the list as an ordered sequence of tiddlers\n* `zoomin`: just renders the current tiddler from the list, with a zoom animation for navigating between tiddlers\n* `pop`: shrinks items in and out of place\n\nIn order for the storyviews to animate correctly each entry in the list should be a single block mode DOM element.\n\n!! History and navigation\n\nThe optional `history` attribute specifies the name of a tiddler that is used to track the current tiddler for navigation purposes. When the history tiddler changes the list view responds by telling the listview to handle navigating to the new tiddler.

On the other hand, the content can be revealed much more quickly. Note that setting ''animate=\"yes\"'' will also force ''retain=\"yes\"''.\n\n! Examples\n\n!! Simple content reveal\n\nHere's a simple example of showing and hiding content with buttons:\n\n<<wikitext-example-without-html '<$button set=\"$:/state/SampleReveal1\" setTo=\"show\">Show me</$button>\n<$button set=\"$:/state/SampleReveal1\" setTo=\"hide\">Hide me</$button>\n\n<$reveal type=\"match\" state=\"$:/state/SampleReveal1\" text=\"show\">\n\n! This is the revealed content\nAnd this is some text\n\n</$reveal>'>>\n\n!!

Introduction\n\nThe select widget displays a popup menu based on a [[HTML select element|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select]]. The popup (or dropdown) contains a list of items defined by `<option>` and `<optgroup>` elements. \nEvery time the user selects a new value in the menu, the selected value is written to the text of a specified tiddler field or index and any ActionWidgets within the `actions` attribute are triggered. Conversely, if the tiddler value is changed independently the select widget is automatically updated to reflect the new value.\n\nIn multiple selection mode, the list of selected values is bound to the specified tiddler field or index. Browsers generally use the <kbd>ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>cmd</kbd> keys for multiple selection.\n\nFor example, this select widget displays a list of the tags in this wiki:\n\n<$macrocall $name=\"wikitext-example-without-html\" src=\"<$select tiddler=<<qualify 'select-demo'>> default='HelloThere'>\n<$list filter='[all[shadows+tiddlers]tags[]sort[title]]'>\n<option value=<<currentTiddler>>><$view field='title'/></option>\n</$list>\n</$select>\"/>\n\nThe <$link to=<<qualify \"select-demo\">>>state tiddler</$link> currently contains:\n\n<$edit-text tiddler=<<qualify \"select-demo\">> tag=\"input\" default=\"\"/>\n\nSee the text change as you switch entries in the select widget. Try changing the value of the state tiddler and see the select widget change. Notice how the select widget only displays an entry if there is a precise match with the tiddler text.\n\n! Content and Attributes\n\nThe content of the `<$select>` widget should be one or more HTML `<option>` or `<optiongroup>` elements that provide the available values.\n\n|!Attribute |!Description |\n|tiddler |The title of the tiddler containing the value to be displayed/modified by the select widget (defaults to the current tiddler) |\n|field |The field name for the value in the current tiddler (defaults to \"text\") |\n|index |The index of a property in a [[DataTiddler|DataTiddlers]] (takes precedence over the field attribute) |\n|class |CSS classes to be assigned to the HTML select element |\n|default |Default value to be used if the tiddler, field or index specifies a missing value |\n|multiple |If present, switches to multiple selection mode |\n|size |The number of rows to display in multiple selection mode |\n|actions |A string containing ActionWidgets to be triggered when the key combination is detected |\n\n! Examples\n\n!! Simple Lists\n\nThis example sets the title of the current wiki [[$:/SiteTitle]] to one of a list of book titles:\n\n<$macrocall $name=\"wikitext-example-without-html\" src=\"<$select tiddler='$:/SiteTitle'>\n<option>A Tale of Two Cities</option>\n<option>A New Kind of Science</option>\n<option>The Dice Man</option>\n</$select>\"/>\n\n!! Value lists\n\nIn this example the `value` attribute has been used to specify the text that should be used as the value of the entry instead of the display text.\n\n<$macrocall $name=\"wikitext-example-without-html\" src=\"<$select tiddler='$:/SiteTitle'>\n<option value='cities'>A Tale of Two Cities</option>\n<option value='science'>A New Kind of Science</option>\n<option value='dice'>The Dice Man</option>\n</$select>\"/>\n\n!! Option Groups\n\nEntries in the list can be grouped together with the `<optgroup>` element\n\n<$macrocall $name=\"wikitext-example-without-html\" src=\"<$select tiddler='$:/SiteTitle'>\n<optgroup label='Fiction'>\n<option value='cities'>A Tale of Two Cities</option>\n<option value='dice'>The Dice Man</option>\n</optgroup>\n<optgroup label='Non-fiction'>\n<option value='science'>A New Kind of Science</option>\n<option value='recursive'>The Recursive Universe</option>\n</optgroup>\n</$select>\"/>\n\n!! Generated Lists\n\nThe ListWidget can be used to generate the options for a select widget. For example, here we combine a select widget listing all the tiddlers tagged ''TableOfContents'' with a transclusion to display the text of the selected one.\n\n<$macrocall $name=\"wikitext-example-without-html\" src=\"<$select tiddler='$:/generated-list-demo-state'>\n<$list filter='[tag[TableOfContents]]'>\n<option><$view field='title'/></option>\n</$list>\n</$select>\n<$tiddler tiddler={{$:/generated-list-demo-state}}>\n<$transclude mode='block'/>\n</$tiddler>\"/>\n\n!! Nested Lists\n\nThis example uses a nested pair of list widgets. The outer one generates the `<optgroup>` elements, and the inner one generates `<option>` elements:\n\n<$macrocall $name=\"wikitext-example-without-html\" src=\"<$select tiddler='$:/generated-list-demo-nestedstate' field='type' default='text/vnd.tiddlywiki'>\n<$list filter='[all[shadows+tiddlers]prefix[$:/language/Docs/Types/]each[group]sort[group]]'>\n<optgroup label={{!!group}}>\n<$list filter='[all[shadows+tiddlers]prefix[$:/language/Docs/Types/]group{!!group}] +[sort[description]]'>\n<option value={{!!name}}><$view field='description'><$view field='title'/></$view> (<$view field='name'/>)</option>\n</$list>\n</optgroup>\n</$list>\n</$select>\"/>\n\n!! Multiple Selections\n\nThis example uses the `multiple` keyword to specify that we should be able to select multiple items.\n\n<$macrocall $name=\"wikitext-example-without-html\" src=\"<$select tiddler='$:/generated-list-demo-state' field='testing' multiple size='8'>\n<$list filter='[tag[TableOfContents]]'>\n<option><$view field='title'/></option>\n</$list>\n</$select><br />\n<$list filter='[list[$:/generated-list-demo-state!!testing]]'>\n<$view field='title' /><br />\n</$list>\n\"/>"},"SetVariableWidget":{"title":"SetVariableWidget","created":"201310241419","modified":"20141025115603373","tags":"Widgets","caption":"setvariable","text":"The `<$setvariable>` widget is a synonym for `<$set/>`; see SetWidget for more details.\n"},"SetWidget":{"title":"SetWidget","caption":"set","created":"20131115182700000","modified":"20180315165405442","tags":"Widgets","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","text":"! Introduction\n\nThe set variable widget assigns a value to a specified [[variable|Variables]]. The new value of the variable is available to the content within the set variable widget.\n\n!

Simple Variable Assignment\n\nThe simplest way of using set variable widget assigns a string to a variable. The following example assigns a literal string\n\n```\n<$set name=\"myVariable\" value=\"Some text\">\n<$text text=<<myVariable>>/>\n</$set>\n```\n\nBoth the name and value attributes can be transcluded. For example:\n\n```\n<$set name=<<anotherVariable>> value={{template!!text}}>\n<$text text=<<myVariable>>/>\n</$set>\n```\n\n!! Conditional Variable Assignment\n\nThis form of the set variable widget chooses one of two specified values according to whether a filter evaluates to an empty list. Here's an example that sets a variable according to whether the current tiddler is called \"myMagicTitle\":\n\n```\n<$set name=\"myVariable\" filter=\"[all[current]field:title[myMagicTitle]]\" value=\"It's magic\" emptyValue=\"It's not magic\">\n<$text text=<<myVariable>>/>\n</$set>\n```\n\n!!

Introduction\n\nA number of extended filters are necessary to manipulate lists. \n\nThe first set of filters are designed to move items from the tail of the list and insert them at specified locations in the list. Items are often appended to the list before using these filters. In general, these filters accept a suffix specifying the number of items to move (default to 1.) \n\nA second set of filters are designed to either add or remove from the list, a selected range of items from an array. These filters are best used with a reference to an array, stored in a field or data index elsewhere in the wiki (they may be used with a simple list of items, provided the items do not include white space.) In general, these filters accept a suffix specifying the number of items to move (default to All.)\n\n! Examples\n\nIn this example we shall populate the '~DataIndex' index of the tiddler '~MyData' with the names of the days of the week, then clear this list. \n\n<$macrocall $name='wikitext-example-without-html'\nsrc=\"\"\"<$button>\n<$action-listops $tiddler=\"ListopsData\" $index=\"DataIndex\" $filter=\"[list[Days of the Week]]\"/>\nGet days-of-the-week\n</$button> \n<$button>\n<$action-listops $tiddler=\"ListopsData\" $index=\"DataIndex\" $filter=\"[[]]\"/>\nClear\n</$button>\n\n{{ListopsData}}\"\"\"/>\n\n---\nIn this example we shall slice the populated list from the 'DaysOfTheWeek' index of the tiddler '~MyData' in order to insert items before and after a marker item (Wednesday) that are first appended to the list.\n\n<$macrocall $name='wikitext-example-without-html'\nsrc=\"\"\"<$button>\n<$action-listops $tiddler=\"ListopsData\" $index=\"DataIndex\" $subfilter=\"one two +[putbefore:2[Wednesday]]\"/>\nPut 2 Items Before Wednesday\n</$button> \n<$button>\n<$action-listops $tiddler=\"ListopsData\" $index=\"DataIndex\" $subfilter=\"four five +[putafter:2[Wednesday]] three +[putbefore[Wednesday]]\"/>\nPut One Item Before & Two Items After Wednesday\n</$button>\n\n{{ListopsData}}\"\"\"/>\n\n---\nIn this example we shall slice the populated list from the 'DaysOfTheWeek' index of the tiddler '~MyData' in order to replace the marker item (Wednesday) with items which are first appended to the list.

Parsing modes\n\nTiddlyWiki parses text in two modes:\n\n* ''inline'' mode recognises character formatting such as emphasis, links\n* ''block'' mode recognises all the ''inline'' formatting, and adds block formatting such as tables, headings and lists\n\nUsually, the mode is determined by whether the transclude widget itself has been parsed in block or inline mode. This can be overridden with the `mode` attribute.\n\nFor example, consider tiddler \"A\" with this content:\n\n```\n# Item one\n#<$transclude tiddler=\"B\"/>\n# Item two\n```\n\nAnd a tiddler \"B\" with this content:\n\n```\n# Item one - a\n# Item one - b\n```\n\nThe result will be something like this:\n\n# Item one\n# # Item one - a # Item one - b\n# Item two\n\nThis can be fixed by amending tiddler \"A\":\n\n```\n# Item one\n#<$transclude tiddler=\"B\" mode=\"block\"/>\n# Item two\n```\n\n! SubTiddler Access\n\nThe transclude widget allows access to the individual tiddlers stored within a [[plugin|Plugins]].\n\nThe following example will transclude the core version of the tiddler [[$:/DefaultTiddlers]] even if it has been overridden:\n\n<<wikitext-example-without-html '\n<$transclude tiddler=\"$:/core\" subtiddler=\"$:/DefaultTiddlers\"/>\n\n'>>\n"},"VarsWidget":{"title":"VarsWidget","created":"20150426115958020","modified":"20150426115958020","tags":"Widgets","caption":"vars","text":"!

Content Parsing\n\nThe content of an HTML element will be parsed in inline mode unless the opening tag is followed by two linebreaks, in which case it will be parsed in block mode. (Inline mode means that block mode formatting such as tables, lists and headings is not recognised).\n\n! Attributes\n\nIn an extension of conventional HTML syntax, attributes of elements/widgets can be specified in several different ways: \n\n* a literal string\n* a transclusion of a TextReference\n* a transclusion of a [[macro/variable|Macros in WikiText]]\n* as the result of a [[Filter Expression]]\n\n!! Literal Attribute Values\n\nLiteral attribute values can use several different styles of quoting:\n\n* Single quotes (eg `attr='value'`)\n* Double quotes (eg `attr=\"value\"`)\n* Tripe double quotes (eg `attr=\"\"\"value\"\"\"`)\n* No quoting is necessary for values that do not contain spaces (eg `attr=value`)\n\nLiteral attribute values can include line breaks. For example:\n\n```\n<div data-address=\"Mouse House,\nMouse Lane,\nRodentville,\nRatland.\"/>\n```\n\nBy using triple-double quotes you can specify attribute values that contain single double quotes. For example:\n\n```\n<div data-address=\"\"\"Mouse House,\n\"Mouse\" Lane,\nRodentville,\nRatland.\"\"\"/>\n```\n\n!! Transcluded Attribute Values\n\nTranscluded attribute values are indicated with double curly braces around a TextReference. For example:\n\n```\nattr={{tiddler}}\nattr={{!!field}}\nattr={{tiddler!!field}}\n```\n\n!! Variable Attribute Values\n\nVariable attribute values are indicated with double angle brackets around a [[macro invocation|Macro Calls in WikiText]]. For example:\n\n```\n<div title=<<MyMacro \"Brian\">>>\n...\n</div>\n```\n\n!! Filtered Attribute Values\n\nFiltered attribute values are indicated with triple curly braces around a [[Filter Expression]].

Should you accidentally forget to define the first parameter or are confused about the order, the next time your macro is run, which might even be triggered using the preview, your template tiddler may inadvertently be overriden with what was intended to be the state.\n"},"Macro Definitions in WikiText":{"title":"Macro Definitions in WikiText","caption":"Macro Definitions","created":"20150220181617000","modified":"20171215152754837","tags":"WikiText","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","text":"A [[macro|Macros]] is defined using a `\\define` [[pragma|Pragma]]. Like any pragma, this can only appear at the start of a tiddler.\n\nThe first line of the definition specifies the macro name and any parameters. Each parameter has a name, and optionally a default value that is used if no value is supplied on a particular call to the macro. The lines that follow contain the macro's text (i.e. the snippet represented by the macro name), until `\\end` appears on a line by itself:\n\n<$codeblock code={{$:/editions/tw5.com/macro-examples/say-hi}}/>\n\nAlternatively, the entire definition can be presented on a single line, without an `\\end` marker:\n\n```\n\\define sayhi(name:\"Bugs Bunny\") Hi, I'm $name$.\n```\n\nA more formal [[presentation|Macro Definition Syntax]] of this syntax is also available.\n\n!! Placeholders\n\nThe snippet can contain placeholders for parameters. These consist of a parameter name between dollar signs, like `$this$`.\n\nIt can also contain placeholders for [[variables|Variables]]. These consist of a variable name (or macro name) between dollar signs and round brackets, like `$(this)$`.\n\nThe actual value of the parameter or variable is substituted for the placeholder whenever the macro is called:\n\n<$importvariables filter=\"$:/editions/tw5.com/macro-examples/say-hi-using-variables\">\n<$codeblock code={{$:/editions/tw5.com/macro-examples/say-hi-using-variables}}/>\n<$macrocall $name=\".example\" n=\"1\"\neg=\"\"\"<$set name=\"address\" value=\"Rabbit Hole Hill\">\n<<say-hi-using-variables>>\n</$set>\"\"\"/>\n</$importvariables>\n\n!! Parameters as Variables\n\nThe parameters to a wikitext macro are also available as special variables named as the parameter name wrapped in double underscores. For example, the example above could also be expressed as:\n\n```\n\\define sayhi(name:\"Bugs Bunny\") Hi, I'm <$text text=<<__name__>>/>.\n```\n\nAccessing parameters as variables only works in macros that are wikified and not, for example, when a macro is used as an attribute value. The advantage of the technique is that it avoids the parameter value being substituted into the macro as a literal string, which in turn can help avoid issues with parameters that contain quotes.\n\nFor example, consider this macro. It is intended to wrap a DIV around another macro invocation, passing through the single parameter to the inner macro:\n\n```\n\\define related-tags(base-tag)\n<div class=\"wrapper\">\n<$macrocall $name=\"anothermacro\" param=\"\"\"$base-tag$\"\"\"/>\n</div>\n\\end\n```\n\nThe code above will fail if the macro is invoked with the argument containing triple double quotes (for example `<<related-tags 'Triple \"\"\" Quotes'>>`). Using parameter variables offers a workaround:\n\n```\n\\define related-tags(base-tag)\n<div class=\"wrapper\">\n<$macrocall $name=\"anothermacro\" param=<<__base-tag__>>/>\n</div>\n\\end\n```\n\n!! Scope\n\nMacros are available to the tiddler that defines them, plus any tiddlers that it transcludes.\n\nTo make a macro available to all tiddlers, define it in a tiddler that has the tag <<.tag $:/tags/Macro>>.\n\nIt is also possible to write a macro as a [[JavaScript module|https://tiddlywiki.com/dev/index.html#JavaScript%20Macros]]. ~JavaScript macros are available to all tiddlers, and offer the maximum flexibility.\n\nA tiddler can manually import macro definitions from a [[selection|Title Selection]] of other tiddlers by using the <<.wlink ImportVariablesWidget>> widget.\n"},"Macros in WikiText":{"title":"Macros in WikiText","created":"20131205160746466","modified":"20150221094003000","tags":"WikiText","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","caption":"Macros","text":"The use of [[macros|Macros]] in WikiText has two distinct aspects:\n\n* [[Defining macros|Macro Definitions in WikiText]]\n* [[Calling macros|Macro Calls in WikiText]]\n"},"Paragraphs in WikiText":{"title":"Paragraphs in WikiText","created":"20131205155836435","modified":"20131214170445345","tags":"WikiText","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","caption":"Paragraphs","text":"To mark the end of a paragraph in TiddlyWiki you need to type `enter` twice to create a double line break:\n\n```\nThis is the first paragraph.\n\nAnd this is the second paragraph.\n```\n\nSingle line breaks are ignored within paragraphs.

Basics\n\nTiddlyWiki5 formats tables using vertical bar characters like so:\n\n```\n|!Cell1 |!Cell2 |\n|Cell3 |Cell3 |\n```\n\nExclamation marks are used to indicate header cells. The example renders as:\n\n|!Cell1 |!Cell2 |\n|Cell3 |Cell3 |\n\n! Cell Alignment\n\nTable cell alignment is controlled by inserting space characters before and/or after the cell content. For example:\n\n```\n|Left aligned content |\n| Right aligned content|\n| Centred content |\n|+++ a very wide column so we can see the alignment +++|\n```\n\nThe example renders as:\n\n|Left aligned content |\n| Right aligned content|\n| Centred content |\n|+++ a very wide column so we can see the alignment +++|\n\n! Cell vertical Alignment\n\nVertical alignment of cells is done by inserting either a `^` for top alignment or a `,` for bottom alignment as the first character of a cell. The normal horizontal alignment is still possible. For example:\n\n```\n|^top left |^ top center |^ top right|\n|middle left | middle center | middle right|\n|,bottom left |, bottom center |, bottom right|\n```\n\nThe example renders as:\n\n| :: | ::::::::::::::::::::::::::: | ::::::::::::::::::::::::::: | ::::::::::::::::::::::::::: | :: |\n| ::<br>:: |^top left |^ top center |^ top right| ::<br>:: |\n| ::<br>:: |middle left | middle center | middle right| ::<br>:: |\n| ::<br>:: |,bottom left |, bottom center |, bottom right| ::<br>:: |\n| :: | ::::::::::::::::::::::::::: | ::::::::::::::::::::::::::: | ::::::::::::::::::::::::::: | :: |\n\nIf you need to have a `^`or a `,` as the first character of a left aligned cell, you can use HTML escaping:\n\n| `^` | &amp;#94; |\n| `,` | &amp;#44; |\n\n! Cell Merging\n\nTo merge a table cell with the one above, use the special cell text `~`. To merge a cell with the one to its left use the text `<`. To merge one to its right use `>`. For example:\n\n```\n|Cell1 |Cell2 |Cell3 |Cell4 |\n|Cell5 |Cell6 |Cell7 |<|\n|Cell5 |~|Cell7 |Cell8 |\n|>|Cell9 |Cell10 |Cell11 |\n```\n\nRenders as:\n\n|Cell1 |Cell2 |Cell3 |Cell4 |\n|Cell5 |Cell6 |Cell7 |<|\n|Cell5 |~|Cell7 |Cell8 |\n|>|Cell9 |Cell10 |Cell11 |\n\n! Table Classes, Captions, Headers and Footers\n\nTable CSS classes, captions, headers and footers can be specified as special pseudo-rows. The following example:\n\n* assigns the CSS classes \"myclass\" and \"anotherClass\" to the table\n* gives the table the caption \"This is a caption\"\n* adds a header row of cells with the text \"Header\"\n* adds a footer row of cells with the text \"Footer\"\n\n```\n|myclass anotherClass|k\n|This is a caption |c\n|Cell1 |Cell2 |\n|Cell3 |Cell3 |\n|Header|Header|h\n|Footer|Footer|f\n```\n\nRenders as:\n\n|myclass anotherClass|k\n|This is a caption |c\n|Cell1 |Cell2 |\n|Cell3 |Cell3 |\n|Header|Header|h\n|Footer|Footer|f\n"},"Transclusion and Substitution":{"title":"Transclusion and Substitution","created":"20141018090608643","modified":"20150220190346000","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","text":"The power of WikiText comes from the ability to use the content of one tiddler inside another one. This ability takes several different forms that can easily be confused.\n\nThe main distinction is between a transclusion and a textual substitution:\n\n* A transclusion is replaced dynamically with the value of either:\n** a tiddler field\n** a variable\n* Textual substitutions are performed on the text of macro definitions before they are used\n\n! Tiddler Field Transclusion\n\n[[Transclusion in WikiText]] describes the basics of transclusion. For example:\n\n```\n{{MyTiddler}}\n```\n\nAs described in [[HTML in WikiText]], you can also transclude tiddler field values as attributes of HTML elements and widgets. For example:\n\n```\n<$text text={{MyTiddler}}/>\n```\n\nAs described in [[Introduction to filter notation]], you can also transclude tiddler field values as filter operands. For example:\n\n```\n{{{ [tag{TiddlerContainingMyTag}] }}}\n```\n\n! Variable/Macro Transclusion\n\nVariables that were defined with parameter or variable substitution are referred to as \"macros\". The value of a variable/macro can be transcluded with the syntax:\n\n```\n<<myMacro param:\"Value of parameter\">>\n```\n\nAs described in [[HTML in WikiText]], you can also transclude a variable as the value of an attribute of HTML elements and widgets. For example:\n\n```\n<$text text=<<myMacro>>/>\n```\n\nAs described in [[Introduction to filter notation]], you can also transclude a variable as the value of a filter operand. For example:\n\n```\n{{{ [tag<myMacro>] }}}\n```\n\n! Textual Substitution\n\nTextual substitution occurs when the value of a macro/variable is used. It is described in [[Macros in WikiText]].\n\nThe key difference between substitution and transclusion is that substitution occurs before WikiText parsing. This means that you can use substitution to build WikiText constructions. Transclusions are processed independently, and cannot be combined with adjacent text to define WikiText constructions.\n"},"Transclusion Basic Usage":{"title":"Transclusion Basic Usage","created":"20141129201509859","modified":"20141130194810119","tags":"[[Transclusion in WikiText]]","caption":"Basic Usage","text":"! Simple Transclusion\n\nTo include some content from [[TiddlerA]] into [[TiddlerB]], edit the latter to include the following text: \n\n```\nThis is the content of TiddlerA: {{TiddlerA}}\n```\n\nThe result is that the content of the ''text'' field (i.e. the main content) of [[TiddlerA]] is rendered within [[TiddlerB]]. \n\n! Usage\n\nThe notation ``{{TiddlerA}}`` is a shortcut for ``{{TiddlerA!!text}}``. This is because the default field for transclusion is ''text'', but any other [[field|TiddlerFields]] can be used explicitly. For example, you can print the last time TiddlerA was modified using:\n\n```\nTiddlerA was modified on {{TiddlerA!!modified}}\n```\n\nBy omitting the tiddler title, the transclusion notation can also be used to display the content of a field from the current tiddler, for example:\n\n```\nThe current tiddler was modified on {{!!modified}}\n```\n\n! Recursion Errors\n\nNotice that using ``{{!!text}}`` or ``{{}}`` causes an error (//Recursive transclusion error in transclude widget//), because it does not make sense to include the content of the current tiddler into the content of the current tiddler (that is, into itself). Whenever you encouter this error message, it means that you are trying to include something into itself, directly or indirectly (for example if tiddler A transcludes tiddler B which transcludes tiddler C which, in turn, transcludes tiddler A).\n\n!

Introduction\n\nIn [[Transclusion Basic Usage]] we have seen how to include the content of a tiddler A into a tiddler B. Now suppose that tiddler A contains:\n\n```\n@@background-color:yellow;\nHello, my title is {{!!title}}\n@@\n```\n\nThis makes tiddler A display its title with a yellow background (see [[Styles and Classes in WikiText]] to learn about CSS style). Imagine that you want to display the title in the same way in tiddler B. But you don't want to copy/paste the style instructions, because you might want to change the background colour later and you want to keep it consistent among tiddlers. This looks like a typical case of transclusion, so let's try to transclude tiddler A in tiddler B the usual way with ``{{A}}``. You should see the following content in tiddler B:\n\n<<<\n@@background-color:yellow;\nHello, my title is A\n@@\n<<<\n\nThe style is applied as expected, but the title is wrong: we want ``{{!!title}}`` to refer to the target tiddler B, and not the source tiddler A.\n\nThe solution is to use a //template//. In this case, the source tiddler A is called the [[TemplateTiddler|TemplateTiddlers]], and it is //applied// to tiddler B using the notation ``{{||A}}``. The difference is that any TextReference which does not refer explicitly to a specific tiddler is applied to the [[current tiddler|Current Tiddler]], that is, the target tiddler. As a result, tiddler B now looks as expected:\n\n<<<\n@@background-color:yellow;\nHello, my title is B\n@@\n<<<\n\n! Usage\n\nTranscluding via a template is like applying a mask: assuming that the source tiddler contains generic references (like eye holes in a mask), these will be replaced with the target tiddlers values (like the eyes of the person who wears the mask).\n\nA template can be applied to any tiddler, not necessarily the current one. This is achieved using the full notation ``{{<target>||<template>}}``. The default ``<target>`` is the [[current tiddler|Current Tiddler]] (this is what we used in the above example).\n\n!

Introduction\n\nJournal tiddlers are tiddlers that use a date and/or time as their title. They are typically used as a quick way to record time-stamped information.\n\nYou can use additional tags on a journal tiddler to link it to other tiddlers, helping to establish the relationships between items of information.\n\nFor example, you might use a journal tiddler called ''10th October 2014'' to record thoughts and information captured on that particular day. The tags ''Shopping'' and ''London'' might be used to indicate that the entry concerns shopping in London.\n\n! Creating a journal tiddler\n\nThe easiest way to create a journal tiddler is to use the ''new journal'' button {{$:/core/images/new-journal-button}} in the ''Tools'' tab of the sidebar. If you find yourself often using the button, click the checkbox next to it to make the button available just above the search box.\n\nThe ''new journal'' button creates a journal entry as a blank tiddler with the tag ''Journal'' and a title derived from today's date. If a journal tiddler with that title already exists, then this is opened for editing.\n\n! Creating a tagged journal tiddler\n\nA common sequence of actions is to create (or reopen) today's journal entry and tag it with the title of another tiddler. This can be done with the ''new journal here'' button {{$:/core/images/new-journal-button}} in the other tiddler's toolbar. You can find this button in the ''Tools'' tab of the tiddler's InfoPanel.\n\nFor example, you might be reviewing a tiddler called ''Oxford Street'' and realise that it's relevant for planning your shopping trip. Click the ''new journal here'' button on the ''Oxford Street'' tiddler to bring up a journal entry tagged with ''Oxford Street''.\n\n! Customising journal tiddlers\n\nTo configure how new journal entries are created, visit the ''Basics'' tab under ''Info'' in the [[control panel|$:/ControlPanel]] {{$:/core/images/options-button}}:\n\n* \"Title of new journal tiddlers\" specifies how these tiddlers should be named, as a [[date format string|DateFormat]]. The default setting of `DDth MMM YYYY` causes new entries to have titles of the form \"10th October 2014\"\n* \"Tags for new journal tiddlers\" [specifies|Title List] tags that will automatically appear on new journal entries. For example: `Journal [[Summer vacation]]`\n\nHint: if you want to create a separate journal tiddler whenever you click ''new journal'' (even if you do this several times in the same day), you can include the clock time in the title format. Specify something like `YYYY-0MM-0DD at 0hhh0mm'0ss''` as the date format.\n\nAnother useful trick is to include `$(currentTiddler)$` somewhere in the title format. This means that if you click ''new journal here'' on several different tiddlers, the title of each of those tiddlers will form part of the name of the resulting journal entries.\n\n! Making a custom new journal button\n\nVisit the [[Making a custom journal button]] tiddler for instructions on how to make your own custom New Journal button"},"Formatting text in TiddlyWiki":{"title":"Formatting text in TiddlyWiki","created":"20140908131500000","modified":"20140919214820549","tags":"[[Working with TiddlyWiki]]","type":"text/vnd.tiddlywiki","text":"Within the text of a tiddler you can use special formatting called WikiText to control how the text is displayed.\n\n! Simple Formatting\n\nAt its simplest, WikiText lets you use familiar word-processing features like bold, italic, lists and tables. For example:\n\n```\nThe ''quick'' brown ~~flea~~ fox //jumps// over the `lazy` dog\n```\n\n… displays as:\n\nThe ''quick'' brown ~~flea~~ fox //jumps// over the `lazy` dog\n\n! Working with Tiddlers\n\nIn WikiText, you can link to tiddlers using double square brackets, or by taking advantage of the automatic linking of CamelCase words:\n\n```\nThis is a link to HelloThere, and one to [[History of TiddlyWiki]]\n```\n\n… displays as:\n\nThis is a link to HelloThere, and one to [[History of TiddlyWiki]]\n\n! Macros\n\nMacros let you package repetitive fragments of WikiText so that you can easily reuse them.\n\nFor example, here is the definition of a macro that generates a ~YouTube video URL from its unique identifier:\n\n```\n\\define youtube(video)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=$video$\n\\end\n```\n\nWith that definition in place, `<<youtube 1g66s7UbyuU>>` generates the URL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1g66s7UbyuU\n\n! Advanced WikiText\n\nAdvanced WikiText features allow you to produce automated lists and interactive features like dropdown menus. In fact, the entire user interface of TiddlyWiki itself is written in WikiText, so any feature that you see in TiddlyWiki can be adapted for use in your own wikis.\n\nSome of the advanced features require complex coding. TiddlyWiki includes several built-in macros that simplify common user interface tasks, like tabs, tables of content, and lists of tiddlers.\n\n!

The wonderful thing about ~TiddlyWiki is that it makes links to tiddlers as accessible as possible. There are links everywhere! Here are the key places where you can find links to tiddlers in ~TiddlyWiki:\n\n* You can ''create a link'' to a tiddler, whether it exists yet or not, in the body of any tiddler. See [[Linking in WikiText]] to see the various easy ways to create links between tiddlers.\n\n* Each ''tag pill'' in your tiddler (such as the ''Working with ~TiddlyWiki'' tag pill below the title of this tiddler) contains a link to that tag's tiddler, as well as lists of all the tiddlers that carry that tag. This lets you go to any of those tiddlers.\n\n* The ''InfoPanel'' of each tiddler gives you access to four tabs containing additional lists of related tiddlers:\n\n** The ''References'' tab lists all the tiddlers that link //to// the current tiddler.\n\n** The ''Tagging'' tab lists all the tiddlers that have been tagged with the current tiddler's title.\n\n** The ''List'' tab lists all the tiddlers (or potential tiddlers) mentioned in the [[list field|ListField]] of the current tiddler.\n\n** The ''Listed'' tab lists all the tiddlers that mention the current tiddler in //their// list fields.\n\n* The ''sidebar tabs'' contain numerous lists of links to tiddlers:\n\n** The ''Open'' tab lists all the tiddlers that are currently open, i.e. visible somewhere on the page.\n\n** The ''Recent'' tab lists the 100 most recently modified tiddlers, beginning with the most recently modified.\n\n** The ''More'' tab offers eight additional lists of tiddlers:\n\n*** ''All'' lists all tiddlers in alphabetical order.\n\n*** ''Tags'' lists all the tags. You can click on the pill for any tag to access a list of the tiddlers tagged with that tag.\n\n*** ''Missing'' lists any tiddlers that don't yet exist, but have been linked to from other tiddlers. This is helpful for finding tiddlers you planned to create, but never got around to.\n\n*** ''Drafts'' lists any tiddlers that are currently in draft mode. ~TiddlyWiki considers a tiddler's draft to be a separate tiddler for as long as you are editing it, so while you're editing a tiddler entitled ''Australia'', there will be two tiddlers, ''Australia'' and ''Draft of 'Australia&apos;''. When you close the draft by saving your changes to it, those changes will be applied to the ''Australia'' tiddler. So treat the ''Drafts'' tab as a way of finding any unfinished drafts you started.\n\n*** ''Orphans'' lists all the tiddlers that are not directly linked from another tiddler. This is a helpful aid to editing your file - it shows you which tiddlers need to be integrated more carefully with the others.\n\n*** ''Types'' lists any tiddlers with special content, such as images or audio.\n\n*** ''System'' lists all of the SystemTiddlers.\n\n*** ''Shadows'' lists all of the ShadowTiddlers.\n\n* ''Search results'' are a list of the tiddlers that contain the text you type in the search box.\n\n* Finally, you can create your own custom lists of tiddlers by various methods:\n\n** You can transclude a [[filter|Filters]] (see [[Transclusion in WikiText]]). For example, adding `{{{ [tag[mountain]] }}}` to a tiddler will insert a list of all tiddlers tagged with ''mountain''.\n\n** You can use the ListWidget.
