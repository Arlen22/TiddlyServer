## TiddlyServer 2.0 "Lite"

TiddlyServer 2.0 takes the server command of TiddlyWiki on NodeJS and adds it to a static file server. This means you can load and serve any TiddlyWiki data folder in the same way you can serve a single file TiddlyWiki. 

But you don't need to serve files and folders from just one place, you can serve them from multiple places anywhere on your harddrive (literally anywhere NodeJS can stat, readdir, and readFile). You can even organize them into virtual folders (aka "aliases" in Apache and "mounts" in Express). 

The main point, of course, is that you can actually edit your files, not just look at them. Single file TiddlyWikis use the put saver, which needs to be patched using a bookmarklet included on the index page. The instructions for this are below under the heading "One thing that needs to be noted".

And, of course, you can edit data folder tiddlywikis just like you were running `node tiddlywiki.js data --server`, except that you run it on the path that you found it at (e.g. http://localhost/personal/notes). You can have as many data folders open as you want, they don't conflict (though they will each take memory).

Data folders store individual tiddlers instead of entire wikis. They take less disk space as they also do not store the core and plugins. This means they also save much quicker, especially over the internet. They also save immediately (within 10 seconds or so) and they save drafts.

### Benefits

* Seemlessly convert between data folders and single-file wikis.
* Allows relative linking to external files. The same link works in both data folders and single files. 
* Allows you to access your wikis from any computer on the network. 
* Files save and load instantly on the same computer, and quickly across the network.
* Mount any location on your computer (in theory, anything NodeJS can stat).

### Features
 - Uses a folder structure specified in settings.json allowing you serve any folders on the filesystem in whatever tree structure you like.
 - Serves all files found in the folder structure.
 - Saves individual files using the put saver.
 - Allows you to upload a file to any directory (but not categories), or create new directories and data folders. 
   - Want to make a custom data folder? First create it as a directory, then upload your custom `tiddlywiki.info` file to it.
 - Loads data folders using TiddlyWiki then forwards all requests to the server command. All data folders are mounted on the path they are found at (e.g. `/personal/mydatafolder`)
 - Saves a backup of the original everytime a single-file TiddlyWiki is saved (if a backup folder is specified in the settings file).

## One thing that needs to be noted for single file wikis before 5.1.15

This does not apply to data folders. 

TiddlyWiki5 files currently use the put saver. The put saver URI encodes the document location, which is usually already encoded by the browser, resulting in a 404 error when saving, if the URL contains any characters that get converted to percent codes (such as %20). 

You will need to use the bookmarklet included in the directory pages to fix the saving. The bookmarklet needs to be clicked each time the affected wiki is opened, after which saving should work normally until the page is reloaded. If there are unsaved changes, another change needs to be made to trigger a save.

The updated tiddler is also included as another link and may be dragged into the wiki to import the tiddler normally. After import the wiki will still need to be saved, either by downloading or by using the bookmarklet.

This is a bug in TiddlyWiki, and is fixed in version 5.1.15. 

## [Change log](CHANGELOG.md)

## Quick Upgrade

Just follow the installation instructions, and copy the `settings.json` file from the old installation to the new one. Any breaking changes in `settings.json` after 2.0.10 will be noted here.

## Quick Install 

* Download and install NodeJS from https://nodejs.org
  * **ProTip:** TiddlyServer only requires `node.exe`, allowing a portable install.
* Download the latest release from https://github.com/Arlen22/TiddlyServer/releases and unzip the TiddlyServer folder contained in the zip file to wherever you want it. 
* Copy `example-settings-simple.json` and rename it `settings.json`.
  * This configuration serves a folder named `data` located in the same folder as `settings.json`. This folder does not exist and must be created.
* Open command prompt and run `/path/to/node /path/to/server.js`.

## FAQ

If these do not answer your question, feel free to open an issue or ask on the TiddlyWiki Google Group.

### TiddlyServer throws a Syntax Error on start up

Make sure you are running at least Node version 6. This is the minimum supported.

## settings.json

Some users find the exact requirements of JSON to be somewhat difficult. If you get the error `The settings file could not be parsed correctly`, it means the settings file contains invalid JSON and could not be parsed. **It does not mean the settings are incorrect, rather that it cannot read them.** You can use a service like https://jsonlint.com/ to show you where the problem is in your JSON file -- just paste in your settings file and click Validate.

The settings.json follows this TypeScript interface definition, except for the properties marked "internal use".

```ts
export interface ServerConfig {
  __dirname: string;          //internal use
  __filename: string;         //internal use
  __assetsDir: string;        //internal use
  _disableLocalHost: boolean; //internal use
  tree: any, //string or "deep hashmap" of string
  types: {
      htmlfile: string[];
      [K: string]: string[]
  }
  username?: string,
  password?: string,
  host: string,
  port: number | 8080,
  backupDirectory?: string,
  etag: "required" | "disabled" | "", //otherwise if present
  etagWindow: number,
  useTW5path: boolean,
  debugLevel: number,
  allowNetwork: ServerConfig_AccessOptions,
  allowLocalhost: ServerConfig_AccessOptions,
  logAccess: string | false,
  logError: string,
  logColorsToFile: boolean,
  logToConsoleAlso: boolean;
  /** cache max age in milliseconds for different types of data */
  maxAge: { tw_plugins: number }           // Coming soon
  tsa: { alwaysRefreshCache: boolean; },   // Coming soon
}
export interface ServerConfig_AccessOptions {
  upload: boolean
  mkdir: boolean
  settings: boolean
  WARNING_all_settings_WARNING: boolean
}
```

All relative folder paths in settings.json are resolved relative to the `settings.json` file itself.

### `tree`

An object (hashmap) with the key being the "folder" name (`http://localhost/alias/`) and the value being either a folder path string, or a hashmap containing "folder" names under that folder. 

In the example above, `/alias2/alias2child/` would end up serving the folder named "folder relative to settings file" next to the settings.json file, and `/alias` will load an absolute path on the file system.

There is no default value for tree. The program will throw an exception if it is not specified. 

There are a few aliases which cannot be used directly under tree as they are reserved for other things on the server. Currently they are `favicon.ico`, `directory.css`, `assets`, `icons`, and `admin`. If tree contains any of these they will simply be ignored. This only applies to the top level tree, not to sub trees.

### `types`

A hashmap with the key being the name of a png file in `assets/icons/files` (without the extension), and the value being an array of extensions listed under that type. This is only used in the directory listing currently.

### `username`

A string specifying the username for Basic Auth and for signing tiddlers when editing data folders. Single file wikis do not get the username set, but will still require Basic Auth. Defaults to an empty string.

### `password`

The password for Basic Auth. Defaults to an empty string.

### `host`

The host IP address to listen on. 

If `127.0.0.1` is specified, then only browsers and software on the local computer will be able to access the server. This is the default if nothing is specified.

If an IP address is specified, then any computer on the network will be able to access the server via that IP address if that IP address is actually assigned to a network interface on the server.

If `0.0.0.0` is specified, then the server will listen on all IP addresses. 

Under the hood, this just uses the default Node HTTP server, so you may refer to that documentation if you want more technical information.

### `port`

The port to listen on. The default is `8080`.

### `backupDirectory`

On every save for all single-file TiddlyWikis, TiddlyServer will gzip the old version and write it to this folder before saving the new version.

If the backupDirectory is specified, it must exist, otherwise saving will fail for all single-file wikis. TiddlyWiki Folders are not backed up and therefore will still save as usual even if the directory does not exist.

If not specified, backup is disabled.

### `etag`

Either `required` or `disabled`. If not specified then only checks etag if the client provides one.

### `etagWindow`

If the etag gets checked and does not match, allow it to save if the file on disk was not modified more than this many seconds later than the modified time in the etag. 

The rationale behind this is that if you have two copies of the same wiki open in two different browser windows, and spend hours working and saving in one, you won't be purposely saving changes to a 3 hour old copy of your wiki for any reason whatsoever. 

But if the file on disk is only 3 seconds newer than the copy in the browser, you probably aren't going to have that much substantial work being saved. If this is your work flow and you want to disable etag altogether, that is possible by setting `etag` to `disabled` (see above).

If nothing is specified, then the etag must match exactly if checked.

### debugLevel

Write debug messages at or above this value to the console. The max recommended is 2, and the minimum recommended is -1 for normal operation. Some debug messages are not implemented when they should be, but the following list is what I use to determine the debug level for a specific message.

 *  4 - Errors that require the process to exit for restart
 *  3 - Major errors that are handled and do not require a server restart
 *  2 - Warnings or errors that do not alter the program flow but need to be marked (minimum for status 500)
 *  1 - Info - Most startup messages
 *  0 - Normal debug messages and all software and request-side error messages
 * -1 - Detailed debug messages from high level apis
 * -2 - Response status messages and error response data
 * -3 - Request and response data for all messages (verbose)
 * -4 - Protocol details and full data dump (such as encryption steps and keys)

### `allowNetwork` and `allowLocalhost`

A set of options specifying whether different actions and pages are allowed for requests coming from the network (`allowNetwork`) and the loopback interface (`allowLocalhost`)

* `mkdir` - Allow network users to create a directory or data folder in the current directory.
* `upload` - Allow network users to upload files to the current directory.
* `settings` - Allow network users to modify some of the settings.
* `WARNING_all_settings_WARNING` - Allow network users to modify all settings.
  * `host`, `port`, `username`, `password`, `allowNetwork`, `allowLocalhost`, `useTW5path`

Whether `tree` will be allowed at all has not been decided yet. There are several serious security problems that need to be considered before allowing the tree variable to be updated via a web request. The main problem is that code running in a sandboxed environment such as a web browser can potentially make calls to localhost and modify the tree to expose sensitive operating system files. One possibility I have considered is to simply provide the new JSON text to the user to copy and paste into `settings.json` themself.

### `logAccess` and `logError`

Specifies the log files to log request info (`logAccess`) and debug info (`logError`) to. If a path is not specified, the info will instead be logged to console using `console.log(...)`.

### `logColorsToFile`

Log the color codes to file. Useful if you read the logs by writing them back to the console. 

### `logToConsoleAlso`.

Log to console regardless of whether we are logging to a file. 

## Detailed Installation Instructions

If upgrading from a previous release of TiddlyServer, do not copy the new files into the old distribution. Unzip the new folder and only copy `settings.json` into it from the old folder. 

Another TiddlyWiki user has written an install guide. It is clear and concise, and will be useful for the average user.

https://www.didaxy.com/introduction-to-tiddlyserver

The instructions below are intended to be detailed and thorough, so read on if you're interested. 

### The Bundled and Source Code versions are now the same

TiddlyServer contains all its dependancies directly in the repository and therefore does not use NPM. The NodeJS executable still needs to be installed (which will also install NPM), or can be copied into the folder for a portable install.

The editions folder from TiddlyWiki is not included because of the number of files it contains. Since it only contains data folders, it is not needed for TiddlyServer to operate. It is included in each release (or in an earlier release) as a separate zip file and is always from the same version of TiddlyWiki as is used in that release.

For convenience, the "server" edition is also included as a separate download because this is used as a data folder template.

If you want to make TiddlyServer portable, just download the binary file instead of the installer. The LTS version (the default) is fine. You will need to download the correct architecture. 32-bit is recommended for maximum portability on most desktops and laptops. If you are going to be using it on a linux or android device, you may need the ARM binaries as the ARM architecture is generally found in micro pc builds, mobile devices, and tablets. __Put the NodeJS binary (node.exe) in the TiddlyServer folder.__ None of the other NodeJS files are needed for a portable install.

 1. Download and install NodeJS from https://nodejs.org
 1. Download the latest release from https://github.com/Arlen22/TiddlyServer/releases and unzip the folder contained in the zip file to wherever you want it. 
 1. Rename `example-settings.json` to just `settings.json` and configure your tree with the actual folders you want to serve. See below for details on settings.json.
 1. Open your terminal or command prompt and run `node server.js` (or `npm start`) or `node server.js /path/to/settings.json` OR run `start.cmd`.
